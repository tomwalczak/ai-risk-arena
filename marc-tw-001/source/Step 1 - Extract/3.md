claim: "The idea that AI will decide to literally kill humanity is a profound category error."
premises:
  - claim: "AI is not a living being that has been primed by billions of years of evolution to participate in the battle for the survival of the fittest."
  - claim: "It is math – code – computers, built by people, owned by people, used by people, controlled by people."
  - claim: "AI doesn’t want, it doesn’t have goals, it doesn’t want to kill you, because it’s not alive."

premises:
  - claim: "Their position lacks a testable hypothesis, criteria for falsifiability, and indicators for entering a danger zone."

  - claim: "John Von Neumann suggested some people confess guilt to claim credit for the sin, implying a mismatch between words and actions of those building and funding AI."
  - claim: "There is a profession around 'AI safety expert', 'AI ethicist', 'AI risk researcher' that benefits from doomsaying."
  - claim: "The 'AI risk' narrative has developed into a cult, attracting not just fringe characters but also industry experts and wealthy donors."

claim: "The 'AI risk' narrative has all the hallmarks of a millenarian apocalypse cult."
premises:
  - claim: "Millenarianism involves the belief in a coming fundamental transformation of society after which all things will be changed."
  - claim: "Only dramatic events are seen as capable of changing the world, and such change is anticipated to be brought about or survived by a group of the devout and dedicated."
  - claim: "In most millenarian scenarios, the disaster or battle to come will be followed by a new, purified world in which the believers will be rewarded."
