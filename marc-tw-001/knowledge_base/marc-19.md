claim: "AI will not ruin our society but instead could cause profound societal harm through outputs deemed harmful."
premises:
  - claim: "This concern has evolved from the AI risk movement, focusing now on societal 'harms' rather than physical danger."
  - claim: "The shift in focus from 'AI safety' to 'AI alignment' reflects this changed concern towards societal implications."

counterargument_to:
  - "AI will inevitably lead to the destruction of society through either physical or existential threats."

strongest_objection:
  - "AI, if not properly aligned with human values, could still lead to significant societal harm despite not posing a physical danger."

consequences_if_true:
  - "There would be a shift in how society prepares for and mitigates AI risks, focusing more on societal harm prevention."
  - "Regulatory and ethical frameworks would need to be developed to ensure AI's outputs are not harmful."
  - "Public perception of AI might shift towards a more nuanced understanding of its potential risks and benefits."

link_to_ai_safety: This argument is intrinsically linked to AI safety by emphasizing the importance of aligning AI with societal values to prevent harm.

simple_explanation: While AI is not going to physically destroy our society, it poses a different kind of threat through the potential for societal harm if its outputs are not properly aligned with human values. This concern marks a shift from fearing AI's physical capabilities to understanding the nuanced ways it could negatively impact society. It's crucial to recognize and address these potential harms proactively, ensuring AI contributes positively to our future rather than detrimentally.

examples:
  - "Misinformation spread by AI could undermine social cohesion and democratic processes."
  - "Biased AI decision-making in criminal justice or hiring could exacerbate social inequalities."
  - "AI-generated content might erode cultural values or norms if not aligned with societal expectations."
