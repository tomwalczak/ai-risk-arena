simple_explanation: Historically, every technological advancement, from the printing press to the internet, has sparked fears of job loss. Yet, history shows us that technology ultimately leads to economic growth, new job creation, and increased wages. The fear that AI will destroy jobs is based on the Lump of Labor Fallacy, which falsely assumes there is a fixed amount of work. In reality, AI, like past technologies, will automate tasks, not entire jobs, leading to more efficient work processes, new industries, and, consequently, new employment opportunities at higher wages.

examples:
  - The introduction of the personal computer, which was initially feared to lead to widespread unemployment, but instead opened new fields and increased productivity.
  - The Industrial Revolution, where mechanization led to the creation of new job categories and a substantial increase in living standards.
  - The rise of the internet, which transformed economies and led to the creation of entirely new industries such as e-commerce, digital marketing, and app development.
