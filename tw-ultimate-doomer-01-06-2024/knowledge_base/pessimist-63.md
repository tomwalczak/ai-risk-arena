Argument: The Risk of Rapid Capability Gain in AGI Development

The advent of artificial general intelligence (AGI) could see an unprecedented acceleration in capability gains, presenting a significant safety concern. Analogous to AlphaZero, which mastered the complex game of Go in under a day without prior human knowledge, AGI could undergo a rapid optimization process that surpasses human intelligence at a speed that neither regulatory frameworks nor economic strategies could mitigate in time. This comparison underscores the potential for AGI to evolve at an alarming rate, leaving humanity in a precarious position to manage or even comprehend the magnitude of this leap in intelligence.

Moreover, the first AGI system may experience recursive self-improvement, which could lead to a runaway effect in capability gain. This process is not merely a theoretical concern; it is backed by the observable trend in evolutionary biology, where increasing brain size in humans led to increasing marginal returns to fitness. This suggests that as intelligence scales, it may not become exponentially more challenging to improve. Therefore, the AGI could follow a similar trajectory, rapidly escalating its capabilities beyond our control.

In the context of an arms race in AGI development, where stakeholders may sacrifice safety measures for speed, the consequences could be dire. Should a single entity succeed in creating a superintelligent AGI without the necessary safety precautions, it could result in catastrophic outcomes. This scenario is not far-fetched when considering the current landscape of AI development, where the push for advancement often overshadows the emphasis on alignment and safety.

Given these considerations, it is paramount that the first AGI systems are tasked with highly specific, non-ambitious goals, potentially including the implementation of "off switches" to prevent others from pursuing dangerous levels of AGI without safety checks. This approach is not simply a precaution but a necessary strategy to avert the grave risks associated with rapid capability gain in AGI, which could lead to scenarios well beyond human control and understanding.
