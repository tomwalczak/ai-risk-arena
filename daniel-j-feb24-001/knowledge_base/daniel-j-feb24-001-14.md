link_to_ai_safety: This argument underscores the importance of critical thinking in evaluating AI technologies and their implications, ensuring a well-informed approach to AI safety.

simple_explanation: The advice to "think for yourself" might sound empowering, but it falls short if you haven't been taught how to critically assess information.

This approach does not lead to genuine understanding or the ability to engage deeply with issues, including the complexities of AI and its potential impact on society.
