claim: "Predicting the future in terms of specific technologies is highly unreliable."
premises:
  - claim: "William Gibson's predictions in Neuromancer were significantly off from how technology actually developed."
    example: "Gibson failed to predict wireless internet access and the omnipresence of portable phones."
  - claim: "Predicting future patterns and abstractions based on historical patterns is more reliable."
counterargument_to:
  - "The claim that specific technological predictions are often accurate and reliable."
  - "The notion that individual genius can accurately foresee the detailed future of technology."

strongest_objjection:
  - "Some specific technological predictions have indeed come true, suggesting that with enough insight, predicting specific technologies isn't always unreliable."

consequences_if_true:
  - "Investing based on specific technological predictions becomes a highly risky endeavor."
  - "Emphasizing broad technological trends and abstractions might lead to more reliable forecasting and planning."
  - "The focus of science fiction and futurism might shift towards exploring potential societal impacts rather than specific technological innovations."

link_to_ai_safety: Predicting the future of technology, including AI, is uncertain, highlighting the importance of preparing for a wide range of outcomes for AI safety.

simple_explanation: Predicting the exact development of future technologies, as exemplified by William Gibson's Neuromancer, is fraught with inaccuracies because it's impossible to foresee the collective innovations that shape technology's evolution. This is because such predictions often miss critical elements, like Gibson's overlooking of wireless internet and the ubiquity of mobile phones. Instead, forecasting based on broader trends and patterns, which are shaped by historical developments and societal needs, tends to be more reliable.

examples:
  - "Gibson's Neuromancer failed to predict the wireless internet and the widespread use of portable phones."
  - "Leonardo da Vinci's flying machine concepts were far removed from the actual development of modern aviation."
  - "Early 20th-century predictions of flying cars as commonplace by the 2000s were significantly off mark."
