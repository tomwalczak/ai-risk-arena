link_to_ai_safety: Understanding and relying on genuine authorities in AI development and ethics can accelerate our ability to create safer AI systems.

simple_explanation: Critical thinking is not about doubting everything but knowing when and which experts to trust. By scrutinizing and understanding the work of those who have dedicated their lives to specific fields, we can learn more quickly and efficiently. This doesn't mean we accept everything at face value but that we use expert knowledge as a valuable starting point for our own exploration and understanding. It's a balance between independent thinking and appreciating the vast landscapes of knowledge that others have charted before us.

examples:
  - "In medicine, relying on established research and expert consensus can guide effective treatment decisions without the need for every doctor to conduct original research."
  - "In technology, understanding fundamental principles laid down by pioneers can help innovators build on solid foundations rather than reinventing the wheel."
  - "In environmental science, leveraging the expertise of climatologists can help policymakers make informed decisions without becoming climate scientists themselves."
