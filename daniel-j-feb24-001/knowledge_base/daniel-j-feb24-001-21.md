claim: "Human perception and models of reality are not always accurate."
premises:
  - claim: "People interpret reality through the filter of their senses and mind's predictions."
  - claim: "There is no statistical model or rubric for accurately predicting AI's future impact."
counterargument_to:
  - "Human perceptions and models are always accurate."
  - "We can predict the future impact of AI with current statistical models and rubrics."

strongest_objection:
  - "Advances in technology and science improve our sensory tools and predictive models, potentially offsetting human limitations in perception and prediction."

consequences_if_true:
  - "It would mean that our understanding and predictions about AI and its impact could be fundamentally flawed or limited."
  - "This could lead to either an underestimation or overestimation of AI's potential risks and benefits."
  - "Policymakers and researchers might need to adopt more flexible, adaptive strategies for AI safety and regulation, acknowledging these perceptual and predictive limitations."

link_to_ai_safety: This argument highlights the critical need for humility and caution in AI safety discussions, acknowledging our perceptual and predictive limitations.

simple_explanation: Our perceptions and the models we build of reality are filtered through our senses and the predictions our minds make, which are not infallible. This means that our understanding of the world, including complex phenomena like AI, is inherently limited and subject to error. Given that there's no foolproof way to predict AI's future impact, we must approach AI development and deployment with caution, constantly questioning our assumptions and prepared to adjust our understanding as new information comes to light.

examples:
  - "Optical illusions trick our senses into seeing something that's not there, highlighting the fallibility of our perception."
  - "The unpredicted rise of the internet and its global impact showcases our limitations in forecasting technological advancements."
  - "Historical predictions that failed to materialize, such as the widespread use of flying cars by the 2000s, demonstrate our challenges with accurate prediction."
