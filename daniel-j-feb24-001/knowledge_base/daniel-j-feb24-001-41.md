claim: "The proposal to pause AI development overlooks how real-world problem-solving works."
premises:
  - claim: "Inventing solutions requires interaction with actual problems, not hypothetical ones."
  - claim: "Technological and safety advancements are iterative and often develop in response to or alongside new technologies."
    example: "Inventions such as safety features like crumple zones and the safety razor were developed as responses to problems posed by the car and the razor."
counterargument_to:
  - The idea that halting AI development is a necessary precaution to ensure safety and prevent potential problems.

strongest_objjection:
  - Pausing AI development might prevent potential harm by giving society time to establish ethical guidelines and regulatory frameworks.

consequences_if_true:
  - Innovation in solving real-world problems would be hindered.
  - Development of safety features and technological advancements would slow down.
  - Immediate societal and economic benefits from AI advancements could be delayed.

link_to_ai_safety: This argument underscores the importance of continuous AI development for the iterative improvement of AI safety features.

simple_explanation: Halting AI development in fear of potential problems underestimates the way we solve issues; through real-world interaction and iteration. Just like the safety razor and crumple zones were developed in response to the problems introduced by their predecessors, safety and technological advancements in AI will also evolve through hands-on problem-solving. Stopping progress means stopping the very process that refines and improves technology.

examples:
  - Safety features in vehicles evolving in response to new automotive technologies.
  - The development of the safety razor as a safer alternative to the traditional straight razor.
  - The iterative improvements in internet security protocols in response to new types of cyber threats.
