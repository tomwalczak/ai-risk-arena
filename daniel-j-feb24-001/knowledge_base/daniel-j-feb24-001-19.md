claim: "Claims regarding AI's peril necessitate definitive evidence and substantiation."
premises:
  - claim: "Assertions about AI's hazards must be corroborated by evidence, echoing the historical trajectory of technology integration."
  - claim: "Sole reliance on expert opinions is inadequate without tangible evidence demonstrating AI's potential threats."
counterargument_to:
  - The argument that the mere assertion of AI's danger by experts is sufficient to warrant caution or regulatory measures.

strongest_objjection:
  - The unique characteristics and unprecedented capabilities of AI may not allow historical comparisons to fully predict its impact, thus expert caution could be justifiably based on theoretical risks.

consequences_if_true:
  - It would shift the burden of proof to those claiming AI’s danger, requiring them to present concrete evidence rather than speculative risks.
  - It could potentially slow down premature regulatory actions that might stifle AI's development and integration into society.
  - It might foster a more evidence-based discussion around AI, focusing on tangible risks and benefits rather than speculative fears.

link_to_ai_safety: This argument emphasizes the importance of evidence-based assessments in discussions about AI safety, advocating for a rational and substantiated approach to evaluating AI's risks.

simple_explanation: When people claim that artificial intelligence (AI) poses dangers, they should back up their claims with solid evidence, just like we require for any other technological advancements. Relying solely on the authority of experts isn’t enough; we need tangible proof to demonstrate that AI is a threat. This approach ensures that discussions about AI’s impact are grounded in reality, allowing for a balanced understanding of its risks and benefits.

examples:
  - Historical fears around the introduction of electricity or automobiles required tangible evidence of their dangers, leading to specific safety improvements.
  - The debate over genetically modified organisms (GMOs) saw claims of danger that necessitated scientific evidence to substantiate any risks.
  - Concerns about the impact of social media on mental health have led to research efforts to provide empirical evidence of its effects.
