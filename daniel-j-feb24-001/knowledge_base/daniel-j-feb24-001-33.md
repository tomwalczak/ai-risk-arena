claim: "Decentralized training and the dramatic fall in the cost of training big models pose a significant challenge to AI safety."
premises:
  - claim: "The cost of training models like an image classifier and state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4 and Llama 2 70B has decreased significantly, from 2012 to 2019 and beyond."
  - claim: "Individuals will soon be able to train powerful AI models on desktop GPU clusters and run them on personal devices, leading to unregulated proliferation of powerful models."
counterargument_to:
  - The belief that only large corporations and research institutions can develop and deploy advanced AI models due to the high costs and resource requirements.

strongest_objection:
  - The reduction in training costs could democratize AI research, allowing for greater innovation and collaboration across the globe, potentially leading to more rapid advancements in AI safety mechanisms.

consequences_if_true:
  - There could be a significant increase in the number of powerful AI models created without oversight, leading to potential misuse.
  - The ease of access to AI model training could result in a proliferation of AI applications with unintended consequences, complicating efforts to ensure global AI safety.
  - The barrier to entry for creating potentially disruptive or harmful AI technology would be significantly lowered, increasing the risk of malicious use.

link_to_ai_safety: This situation directly threatens AI safety by making it easier for unregulated and potentially harmful AI technologies to be developed and deployed.

simple_explanation: As the cost of training powerful AI models like GPT-4 and Llama 2 70B dramatically decreases, and as it becomes possible to train these models on personal computing setups, we face a new challenge. Very soon, individuals could develop advanced AI technologies on a scale previously only possible for large organizations. This decentralization of AI development poses a significant threat to AI safety, as it could lead to the unregulated creation and use of powerful models, making it harder to prevent misuse or unintended harmful consequences.

examples:
  - An individual with modest resources creating a powerful AI model that can generate deepfakes, spreading misinformation at an unprecedented scale.
  - A small startup quickly developing and deploying an advanced AI system with significant societal impact, without thorough ethical review or safety checks.
  - Hobbyist programmers creating and sharing powerful AI models that could be repurposed for cyberattacks or other malicious activities, without any oversight.
