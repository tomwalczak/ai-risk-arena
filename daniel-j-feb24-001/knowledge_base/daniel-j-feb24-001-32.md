claim: "Attempts to universally ban large AI models are unrealistic and would be ineffective."
premises:
  - claim: "Proposing universal bans on large AI models is based on unrealistic expectations and overlooks political realities."
  - claim: "No major nation would consent to such bans, which rely on speculative risks rather than empirical evidence."
  - claim: "Even if such an agreement were hypothetically reached, adherence by all, especially authoritarian countries, would be improbable."
counterargument_to:
  - "Large AI models pose significant existential risks that necessitate global bans or severe restrictions to ensure humanity's safety."

strongest_objjection:
  - "The potential existential risks posed by unchecked AI development may outweigh the consequences of stifling innovation in some regions, making a global agreement essential for human safety."

consequences_if_true:
  - "Western nations may inadvertently cede technological leadership to non-Western nations or authoritarian regimes."
  - "The global disparity in technological advancement could lead to imbalances in power and influence, potentially destabilizing international relations."
  - "The inability to enforce a universal ban could result in a fragmented approach to AI governance, leading to loopholes and enforcement challenges."

link_to_ai_safety: This argument underlines the pragmatic challenges in achieving global consensus on AI safety measures, highlighting the need for realistic and cooperative strategies.

simple_explanation: Proposing a universal ban on large AI models is a well-intentioned idea aimed at mitigating potential risks. However, it's unrealistic because it assumes all major nations, including those with different interests and governance styles, would agree to and strictly adhere to such a ban. This approach could also stifle innovation in countries that do implement it, inadvertently giving non-compliant nations—likely non-Western or authoritarian—a technological and strategic advantage. It's essential to find a more practical way to address AI risks that considers political realities and the global landscape.

examples:
  - "The international community's varied response to climate change agreements shows the difficulty of achieving unanimous agreement on global issues."
  - "The arms race during the Cold War, where mutual distrust led to an escalation rather than a reduction in nuclear arsenals."
  - "The global digital divide, where access to and control of technology is unevenly distributed among nations, could be exacerbated by unilateral restrictions on AI development."
