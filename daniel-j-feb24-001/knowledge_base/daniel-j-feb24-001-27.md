claim: "Technology and our collective advances have significantly improved global living standards."
premises:
  - claim: "Since 1800, the global population has increased sixfold, while average life expectancy has more than doubled, and real income has risen over nine times."
  - claim: "From 1955 to 2005, the average person on Earth saw their income nearly triple, consumed one-third more calories, buried one-third as many children, and could expect to live one-third longer, with significant reductions in deaths from war, murder, natural disasters, and diseases."
  - claim: "It is nearly impossible to find any place on Earth not better off now than in 1955, indicating widespread benefits from technology and collective progress."
counterargument_to:
  - "Technological advancements and collective progress have predominantly negative impacts on society and the environment."
  - "The quality of life for the average person has stagnated or declined over the past centuries."

strongest_objection:
  - "Despite these improvements, the distribution of wealth and access to technology remains uneven, leading to significant disparities in living standards across different regions and within societies."

consequences_if_true:
  - "An acknowledgment of the positive impact of technology and collective human effort on global living standards could encourage further investment in technological and social innovations."
  - "Recognizing these advancements might shift focus towards addressing inequalities, ensuring that the benefits of technological progress are more evenly distributed."
  - "A deeper understanding of the link between technological advancement and improved living standards could foster a more optimistic and proactive approach to solving global challenges."

link_to_ai_safety: The argument underscores the importance of harnessing technology, including AI, for the betterment of humanity, highlighting the potential of AI to continue improving living standards if developed and used responsibly.

simple_explanation: Since 1800, our world has seen remarkable progress: the global population has increased sixfold, but more impressively, average life expectancy has more than doubled, and real income has risen over nine times. From 1955 to 2005 alone, the average person’s income nearly tripled, their diet became richer, child mortality rates plummeted, and they lived significantly longer, all while witnessing reductions in deaths from various causes. This incredible trajectory of improvement makes it hard to find any place on Earth that hasn't benefited from technological advancements and collective human progress. It's a testament to how far we've come together, and a reminder of the potential we have to tackle the challenges that lie ahead.

examples:
  - "The eradication of diseases like smallpox and significant reductions in others such as polio and measles, thanks to global vaccination efforts."
  - "The dramatic increase in global literacy rates, enabled by improved access to education through both traditional means and technological innovations like the internet."
  - "The widespread adoption of technologies like refrigeration, which has significantly improved food safety and storage, contributing to better health and reduced hunger."
