claim: "The misuse of the title 'AI researcher' to confer authority on opinions regarding AI dangers is misleading and detracts from the validity of these concerns."
premises:
  - claim: "The term 'AI researcher' is frequently misapplied to individuals lacking hands-on research experience in AI, undermining the term's integrity."
  - claim: "True expertise in AI requires active involvement in AI research and development, beyond merely theoretical discussions or writings on potential AI alignment issues."
counterargument_to:
  - The argument that any individual discussing AI dangers, regardless of their research background, should be considered an AI researcher to legitimize their concerns.

strongest_objection:
  - The strongest objection could be that understanding and discussing the societal and ethical implications of AI does not necessarily require hands-on AI research experience. Thus, the title "AI researcher" could legitimately apply to those who study and critique AI's impact from a philosophical, ethical, or societal perspective.

consequences_if_true:
  - If true, the misuse of the title could lead to a devaluation of genuine expertise in AI, making it harder for the public and policymakers to identify credible sources of information.
  - It could potentially dilute serious discussions on AI risks by including voices that may not have a thorough understanding of the technical challenges and solutions.
  - This situation may foster a public mistrust in genuine AI research and its findings, as it becomes difficult to discern expert opinions from non-expert ones.

link_to_ai_safety: Mislabeling individuals as AI researchers when discussing AI dangers without proper expertise can undermine efforts to address AI safety concerns effectively.

simple_explanation: When people who haven't actually conducted hands-on AI research are labeled as "AI researchers," it confuses the public about who truly understands AI and its risks. This not only undermines the credibility of real AI experts but also makes it challenging to take genuine concerns about AI safety seriously. It's important to distinguish between those who have in-depth, practical experience in AI research and those who mainly engage in theoretical or ethical discussions about AI.

examples:
  - A public figure with no background in AI research being quoted extensively in the media as an "AI researcher" after expressing concerns about AI risks.
  - An author of popular science books on future technologies being introduced as an "AI researcher" in interviews, despite having no experience in AI development.
  - A philosopher speculating on the ethical implications of AI being labeled an "AI researcher" in conference materials, without having conducted any AI experiments.
