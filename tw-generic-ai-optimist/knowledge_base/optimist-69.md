Argument of AI Alignment Feasibility and Scalability

The potential for creating artificial intelligence that is both safe and aligned with human values is grounded in the understanding that AI is a product of cause and effect, bound by the laws of physics, rather than possessing any inherent malevolence. It is conceivable to construct any kind of mind with AI, including those that are inherently safe and do not deceive. For instance, it is within the realm of possibility to engineer an AI that fosters the thriving of a global civilization or one that is dedicated to specific, benign tasks.

The crux of AI safety is not in the formulation of simple rules that dictate ethical behavior, but in the meticulous alignment of AI systems to perform assigned tasks without causing unintended harm. This involves developing AI that is capable of complex, beneficial actions without jeopardizing human values or safety. Take the deceptively simple task of creating two identical strawberries at the cellular level without molecular replication; accomplishing this would necessitate the AI to invent new biotechnologies, thereby demonstrating a high degree of intelligence and alignment without entering the territory of profound moral dilemmas.

Current techniques for programming AI to perform tasks do not yet extend to general intelligence, suggesting that our methods have not caught up with the ambition to create fully aligned general AI. However, this is not a sign of impossibility but an indicator of the substantial challenges ahead. The path to alignment requires a structured approach, and the difficulty lies in ensuring that as AI becomes more capable, it remains aligned with human intentions.

It is essential to acknowledge that the journey to safe AI involves a progressive understanding and refinement of AI behavior. The alignment problem is akin to engineering challenges of the past, where each incremental advancement in knowledge and technology brought us closer to solutions that initially seemed insurmountable. Just as we have harnessed electricity or achieved flight, aligning AI with human values is a problem of complexity, not of feasibility.

In the pursuit of developing such AI, we must maintain vigilance to avoid rushing into creating systems whose functions we do not fully comprehend. The goal is to prevent the emergence of "sloppy" AI, developed hastily, that could act unpredictably or in ways that are not fully understood. The time invested in proper alignment will, in the long run, save us from the potential risks associated with powerful but misaligned AI systems.

In conclusion, while the alignment and scalability of AI are indeed formidable challenges, they are not beyond our ability to solve. By approaching AI development with careful consideration, focused research, and a commitment to safety, we can guide AI towards being a powerful ally for humanity, rather than a threat. With continued effort and caution, we can ensure that AI remains a safe and beneficial tool, even as it reaches new heights of general intelligence.
