4. Argument of General-Purpose Technology Proliferation, AI's Predictable Progression, and Human Augmentation

Artificial Intelligence, as a general-purpose technology, has historically followed a trajectory of increasing complexity and capability, similar to the waves of transformative technologies like fire, the wheel, and electricity. These technologies have revolutionized our society by becoming more affordable, accessible, and by enabling further innovation. AI is no exception to this pattern; it continues to evolve, becoming more integrated into various facets of daily life and contributing to the democratization of services that were previously inaccessible to many.

From its inception, AI has been envisioned as a tool that can augment human intelligence across a wide spectrum of activities. The progression from simple tasks such as image and audio recognition to more sophisticated capabilities like text generation and nuanced understanding underscores AI's predictable development path. This growth trajectory indicates a future in which AI will increasingly serve to enhance human capabilities rather than supplant them.

The potential societal benefits of AI are vast. General-purpose AI, capable of learning and adapting to myriad tasks, holds the promise of delivering a respectable standard of living to all people on Earth. By leveraging AI's scalability and efficiency, we can envision a world where access to the best medical advice, education, and personal assistance is not a privilege of the few but a common good accessible to billions. This reflects the meritocratic potential of AI, similar to how the smartphone has become a universal tool regardless of socioeconomic status.

Moreover, the exponential decrease in the cost of technology over the past 70 years has facilitated widespread access to powerful tools, indicating that AI will follow a similar path towards mass adoption. The proliferation of AI is expected to lead to a Cambrian explosion of productivity, enabling individuals to more effectively pursue their goals and contribute to a collective increase in human capability.

In conclusion, AI's historical pattern of predictable advancements, coupled with its role as a general-purpose technology, suggests a future where it acts as a catalyst for human augmentation. By enhancing and democratizing access to high-quality services, AI has the potential to promote equality and improve the standard of living globally, making it a safe and transformative technology for society.
