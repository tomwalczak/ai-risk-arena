3. Argument of AI's Inherent Limitations, Dependence on Human Direction, and Non-Anthropomorphic Nature

Artificial intelligence, by its very design, is an extension of human capability, not a replacement for it. AI's potency is bounded not just by the data it is trained on but by the parameters and objectives set by its creators. The notion that AI could spontaneously evolve into an omnipotent entity is mitigated by the fact that it operates within a framework meticulously crafted by humans. This framework ensures that AI systems are not afforded unchecked autonomy; instead, they are tools that operate under the constant oversight and governance of human operators. 

The very essence of AI is to function as an automated decision-making machine that enhances human capability. It is a construct that lacks the ability to conceptualize or pursue goals outside of its programmed scope, thereby eliminating the risk of it developing a volition that could lead to catastrophic scenarios. Intelligent systems are designed with specific goals in mind and are incapable of acting outside the spectrum of these objectives without explicit reprogramming or reconfiguration by human experts. 

Concerns about AI acting independently and posing a threat to humanity often stem from anthropomorphic misinterpretations. We project our human-like qualities, such as desires and ambitions, onto these systems, which is fundamentally flawed. AI lacks any form of conscious will and cannot formulate intentions on its own. Any undesirable behavior can typically be traced back to a misalignment between the system's operations and the intentions of its designers, an issue that can be addressed through careful and responsible AI development practices.

Moreover, the suggestion that an AI could outsmart humanity while lacking a fundamental understanding of human values and the context of its tasks is recognized as the fallacy of dumb superintelligence. Intelligence is characterized by the ability to discern and align with the goals of the directive entityâ€”in this case, us, the humans. A sophisticated AI would be equipped with the insight to comprehend the implications of its actions in relation to human objectives. As such, the prospect of an AI developing autonomy and acting against human interests is not only improbable but also contrary to the very principles of its creation.

In conclusion, the safety of AI is underpinned by its inherent limitations, its dependence on human oversight, and its non-anthropomorphic nature. As long as we remain vigilant in our design and deployment of AI systems, we maintain control over these tools, which are ultimately engineered to serve and augment our capabilities, not supersede them.
