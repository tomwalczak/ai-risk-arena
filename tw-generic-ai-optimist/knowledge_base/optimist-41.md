Argument of Theoretical Computer Science and Mathematical Formalization in AI Safety

Advancements in theoretical computer science and mathematical formalization are vitally important for ensuring the safety of AI systems. By rigorously applying these disciplines, we can create a framework that precisely defines and measures the concepts of agency, safety, power seeking, and instrumental convergence. These concepts are essential for understanding the potential risks associated with AI and for developing strategies to mitigate those risks.

The creation of new mathematics and theoretical frameworks is not merely an academic exercise; it is a necessity for the ongoing development and control of AI systems. As we have seen in other fields of science and engineering, progress requires a foundation of either empirical data or a formal mathematical theory. For a long time, AI safety lacked both. However, the advent of capable AI models has provided us with empirical data, allowing us to test hypotheses and refine our theoretical approaches.

Consider the example of AI systems controlling vehicles, power plants, and financial markets. Even simple software bugs can lead to catastrophic failures, underscoring the need for robust safety mechanisms. Just as we have developed seat belts for automobiles and clinical trials for medicine, we must develop and implement safety mechanisms for AI. These mechanisms are akin to seat belts for the digital realm, providing necessary protection as the technology becomes increasingly integrated into our daily lives.

AI safety research is entering a golden age where we can finally apply empirical data and rigorous mathematical theories to real-world scenarios, enhancing our ability to safeguard against potential risks. By pursuing a variety of promising strategies and continuing to invest in research, we will ensure that the benefits of AI vastly outweigh the risks. Safety is not only a technical necessity but also the most politically viable path forward, ensuring that AI remains a trusted and beneficial aspect of our technological landscape.
