1. Argument of AI as a Controllable Complex System

Artificial intelligence, conceptualized as a software entity, inherently possesses the potential for bugs and imperfections. However, the nature of software allows for these issues to be addressed through debugging and iterative development processes. As a complex system, AI shares characteristics with other systems we have experience managing, such as the financial markets. Indeed, the financial crisis of 2008 demonstrated the unpredictability of complex systems, yet we have learned to apply risk management strategies like fault tolerance, redundancy, and robustness to safeguard against unforeseen failures. These strategies are transferrable to the domain of AI, enabling us to preemptively address and mitigate potential risks.

Moreover, should AI evolve into a powerful agent with interests not aligned with our own, we are equipped with a wealth of experience in handling principal-agent dilemmas. By implementing incentive alignment, monitoring, and establishing clear contractual obligations, we can exercise a degree of control over AI systems to ensure that they act in accordance with human objectives.

The process of AI development could benefit from a gradual and measured approach, providing us with ample time to study and understand the intricacies of AI motivation and behavior. If we can achieve a slow progression towards more advanced AI, we can harness the labor of AI systems that are powerful yet not beyond our control. This strategy enables us to learn how to effectively align AI systems with human intent, thereby significantly reducing the risk of losing control over superhuman AI systems.

The concern about AI systems operating outside of human control is rooted in a lack of understandingâ€”a problem that is not unique to AI but common to all emerging technologies. History demonstrates that with sufficient research, experimentation, and a proactive approach to risk management, we can navigate these challenges. AI, being a product of human ingenuity, is ultimately subject to human governance and oversight. By fostering a culture of responsible AI development and deployment, we can ensure that the rise of artificial intelligence remains a safe, controlled, and beneficial advancement for society.
