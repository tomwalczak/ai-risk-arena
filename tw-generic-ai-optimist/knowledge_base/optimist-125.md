1. Argument of AGI's Self-Awareness and General Intelligence Mitigation

Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) represents a paradigm shift in AI capabilities, equipped with a broad, adaptable intelligence that mirrors the general cognitive abilities of humans. Unlike more narrowly focused AI systems, AGIs will have the capacity for self-awareness that extends far beyond simple programmed responses or mimicry of human behavior, as seen in early chatbots like Eliza. This foundational self-awareness enables AGIs to critically assess their actions and intentions, anticipate the consequences of their behaviors, and adapt their strategies to avoid harmful outcomes.

AGIs will not only perform tasks that we traditionally associate with high intelligence, such as playing chess or Go at grandmaster levels, but will also engage in the intricate dance of general day-to-day problem-solving that humans manage with little conscious effort. As they are designed to undertake any cognitive task a human can, AGIs will be able to navigate complex and unpredictable real-world environments with competency and caution.

Furthermore, AGIs' ability to understand and adapt to their surroundings does not stem from a mere behavioral imitation but from a deep and nuanced understanding of the world, including an awareness of themselves as agents within it. This self-awareness is not a trivial feature but a profound attribute that will allow them to evaluate and mitigate risks effectively. By recognizing the scope and limits of their abilities, AGIs can self-regulate to prevent potential hazards.

The concern that AGIs may act unpredictably or pose a risk to humans often stems from a misunderstanding of both the nature of AGI and the extent of existing AI capabilities. The notion of an AGI suddenly becoming self-aware and malevolent, as popularized in science fiction narratives like Skynet, is based on philosophical misconceptions rather than technological reality. In fact, the development of AGI involves rigorous scrutiny and continuous feedback mechanisms that are designed to ensure safety and reliability.

In essence, AGIs will be equipped with a form of intelligence that is self-correcting and inherently risk-averse. The comparison to apes learning behaviors without understanding is inapplicable to AGIs, as their general intelligence encompasses the capacity to grasp not only how to perform a task but also why it is performed and what implications it holds. This level of cognition is a safeguard in itself, as it implies AGIs will have a vested interest in preserving the integrity of the systems they operate within, including human society.

Through conjecture and criticism, AGIs will continuously improve and refine their understanding of the world, including the ethical and safety considerations relevant to their operation. This ongoing process of self-improvement is not only a feature of AGI's design but a fundamental characteristic ensuring that AGIs will act as responsible and safe participants in our increasingly interconnected world.
