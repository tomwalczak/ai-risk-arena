1. Argument for Autonomous Limitation and Regulatory Measures in AI Systems

The prudent application of AI technologies necessitates the establishment of structured regulatory frameworks that can mitigate potential risks associated with AI's increasing autonomy. The concept of restricting the autonomy of AI systems is not only plausible but necessary to prevent AI from evolving beyond its intended purpose, potentially developing unintended objectives or exhibiting power-seeking behaviors. By implementing a phased integration approach, AI models can be safely linked to external applications after rigorous risk analysis and assessment. This measured process ensures that any risk posed by the integration is thoroughly evaluated and managed before it occurs.

Moreover, the incorporation of AI in critical decision-making scenarios, such as military or infrastructure, underscores the need for stringent regulatory oversight. For instance, AI's role in decision support systems could inadvertently escalate conflicts, as highlighted by the hypothetical scenario of a nuclear exchange in the Taiwan Strait due to AI misinterpretation. This example illustrates the tangible risks posed by AI and the urgency of comprehensive regulatory measures.

To further ensure the safety of AI applications, regulatory bodies, such as those responsible for the EU AI Act, have classified AI systems based on the level of risk they carry. High-risk applications, including AI in hiring decisions or critical infrastructure, are subject to strict scrutiny. They require detailed documentation of the datasets used, measures against bias, and the risks identified, along with the mitigation measures taken. Prohibited applications, such as social scoring systems and subliminal manipulation, demonstrate a proactive stance in preventing abuses of AI.

By categorizing AI systems and enforcing regulatory compliance, policymakers can effectively safeguard against the most severe risks while providing guidance for lower-risk applications. This regulatory approach reflects a growing consensus among leading AI researchers and policymakers who recognize the profound implications of AI's development and are earnestly engaging with the challenges it presents. Through these measures, we can establish a responsible framework that ensures AI remains a beneficial tool for humanity, rather than a threat.
