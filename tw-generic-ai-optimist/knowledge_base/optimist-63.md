1. Argument of Gradualism, Controllability, and Oversight in AI Development

The development of AI is a meticulous process that involves careful and incremental progress. This is facilitated by the need for large, well-labeled datasets, which not only feed the learning algorithms but also provide a clear trace for continuous monitoring and evaluation of AI behavior. This step-by-step advancement ensures that the evolution of AI capabilities is neither unexpected nor unmanageable. 

Far from the concept of a sudden and uncontrolled "FOOM" scenario, where AI would rapidly and unpredictably surpass human intelligence, the reality is that AI advancement is more akin to a steady climb, allowing for ample opportunity to assess risks and make necessary adjustments. This measured progress ensures that potential hazards can be mitigated before they become critical, thus maintaining human oversight over AI systems.

Furthermore, the design of AI systems incorporates mechanisms for self-regulation and oversight, with advanced AI systems capable of monitoring and ensuring the proper function of other AI systems. This creates a safeguard where AI not only performs tasks but also checks and balances its own processes. An example of this is the use of AI in cybersecurity, where it not only detects threats but also provides real-time defense measures, all under human supervision.

In addition, the rate at which AI systems enable progress is not as exponential as sometimes portrayed. For instance, while AI might accelerate the design of better algorithms or hardware, this does not necessarily lead to an immediate leap to superhuman capabilities. Instead, it allows for a more profound understanding of AI's cognitive and motivational systems, providing an opportunity to align them with human intentions and ethics. The gradual improvement in AI capabilities is, therefore, a period of valuable learning that can be used to develop robust control mechanisms over superhuman AI systems.

Moreover, the presence of humans in the loop is a critical aspect of AI development. It is recognized that as we delegate tasks to AI, it is imperative to maintain human oversight to ensure outcomes remain aligned with our objectives and values. Especially in the domain of AI development itself, the involvement of human expertise is vital to guide the evolution of AI capabilities in a safe and controlled manner.

In summary, AI development is characterized by controlled, gradual improvements, with consistent human oversight and a framework for AI systems to regulate each other, ensuring safety and alignment with human intent. This approach significantly reduces the likelihood of losing control over AI systems and allows humanity to harness the benefits of AI while effectively managing potential risks.
