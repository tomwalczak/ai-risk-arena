Regulatory and policy measures are essential tools for managing the potential risks associated with artificial intelligence. These measures encompass a broad spectrum of legal frameworks, industry standards, and ethical guidelines tailored to the multifaceted nature of AI technology. The implementation of such regulations does not hinge on the belief in the imminent arrival of artificial general intelligence but rather focuses on addressing the here-and-now of AI applications.

For instance, regulatory risk identification is a fundamental aspect that applies to most, if not all, AI systems, ensuring that any sources of risk are acknowledged and mitigated accordingly. This proactive approach is crucial, given that AI is increasingly integrated into critical infrastructures and decision-making processes, which could, in extreme cases, lead to significant consequences, such as an inadvertent nuclear exchange due to the misuse of AI in decision support systems.

The establishment of comprehensive regulatory frameworks, such as the European Union's AI Act, demonstrates a forward-thinking approach to AI governance. The AI Act not only prohibits certain AI applications deemed too risky, like social scoring systems or subliminal manipulation but also categorizes AI applications by risk level. High-risk applications, such as those integrated into critical infrastructure or used in hiring decisions, are subjected to stringent requirements. Developers must disclose datasets used, measures taken against biases, and risk mitigation strategies, ensuring transparency and accountability.

Moreover, the involvement of leading AI academics in policy discussions has signaled a paradigm shift in the seriousness with which policymakers approach AI governance. Their deep concerns about the potential of AI to match or surpass human abilities have catalyzed a more profound engagement with AI safety and ethics.

In addition to legislative efforts, executive orders like the one in the United States exemplify a holistic approach to AI risks, encompassing the role of AI in employment, housing, education, and more. These orders mandate red teaming exercises and information sharing with government authorities, illustrating a commitment to both ethics and safety in AI without prioritizing one over the other.

In summary, the collaborative efforts between governments, academia, and industry to create and enforce regulatory and policy measures underscore our collective dedication to ensuring AI is used safely and ethically. By continuously adapting these measures to the evolving landscape of AI technology, we maintain a robust framework that safeguards against risks while fostering innovation and trust in AI systems.
