4. Argument of AI as a Beneficial Leverage, General-Purpose Technology, and Economic Impact

Artificial Intelligence stands as a transformative technology, akin to the invention of general-purpose technologies like fire or the wheel. Historically, general-purpose technologies have not only redefined the way we live but have also served as catalysts for economic and social revolutions. As AI integrates into core industries, its potential for increasing productivity is profound. For instance, envision a legal professional who, with the aid of AI, can draft thirty documents in the time it would normally take to draft one. This is not merely a hypothetical; it is a tangible reflection of the leverage AI provides.

Moreover, the trajectory of AI's impact on economic growth mirrors that of computers, albeit with a promise of more significant outcomes. While computers have maintained economic growth trends, AI promises to usher in an era of productivity explosion. The onset of advanced systems, particularly General-Purpose AI, is poised to automate tasks across all human labor sectors, potentially triggering transformative and unprecedented economic impacts. With General-Purpose AI, we could achieve a scale of productivity and efficiency that could extend a respectable standard of living to every individual on Earth.

The economic implications are staggering. A tenfold increase in GDP from leveraging AI could translate into a net present value of roughly $13.5 quadrillion. This estimate underscores AI's potential to serve as a beneficial leverage technology, driving economic growth and productivity to new heights. The significance of this technology is not merely in its economic value but in its ability to fundamentally enhance our civilization, built on the very foundation of intelligence. By harnessing AI, we have the opportunity to elevate our collective standard of living and embark on one of the most productive periods in human history.
