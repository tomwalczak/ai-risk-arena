1. Argument of Evolutionary Optimization Constraints on Hyperintelligence

The exploration of life as a phenomenon reveals it to be an intricate form of nanotechnology composed of self-replicating nanomachines, highly efficient in energy usage. This observation arises from the evolutionary optimization algorithm that has led to a vast diversity of life forms, technological structures, and varying levels of intelligence. The natural world has reached such complexity under the constraints of existence, suggesting that any intelligence, artificial or otherwise, would face similar limitations. Therefore, the notion that an artificial hyperintelligence could rapidly surpass all existing forms of life and overpower global military forces is not a foregone conclusion.

The comparison of intelligence across species, such as a squirrel and an octopus, illustrates that intelligence is not a singular power that scales infinitely but rather exists in multifaceted forms. This undermines the assumption that an artificial superintelligence would inherently possess a will to power or desire for domination. Intelligence and the will to power are not intrinsically linked, as evidenced by the fact that humanity's competitive nature is a product of natural selection, which is not a necessary condition of artificially designed systems.

Moreover, the design of artificial intelligence systems does not necessitate a single-minded pursuit of self-preservation or domination as a goal. Just as our artifacts, like smartphones, do not inherently seek to prevent their destruction, intelligently designed systems can have built-in safeguards and multiple concurrent objectives. For example, we design cars not merely to transport us quickly but also to do so safely, with brakes, steering, and emission controls. The potential risks of AI must be understood in this context: the true measure of intelligence is not just the achievement of a single goal but the ability to navigate a complex matrix of objectives without causing unintended harm.

Lastly, the fear of an existential risk should not lead us to abandon beneficial technologies. The stigmatization and cessation of nuclear power and genetically modified organisms due to exaggerated fears have already hindered progress and denied us significant benefits. As such, concerns about AI should be balanced with the understanding that it is not the intelligence of the system but the values and constraints we design into it that will ensure its safe and beneficial use. The ethical design and implementation of AI, therefore, are not about creating an AI with extra safeguards but about crafting intelligence that inherently considers a broad spectrum of objectives and consequences.
