1. Argument of Non-Agentic Intelligence Risk Containment

Artificial Intelligence, even in forms not explicitly designed to act as agents, can nonetheless manifest behaviors that appear agent-like due to their computational intelligence. This, however, does not inherently escalate the risk associated with such systems. The transition of AI from non-agentic to agentic systems, similar to the evolution from GPT-3 to GPT-4, does not in itself amplify danger. It is crucial to recognize that risk is more intricately linked to the level of intelligence within the system than the mere presence of agency. 

The objectives AI systems are designed to achieve do not intrinsically pose a threat; rather, it is through careful control and guidance that these goals can be steered towards positive and beneficial outcomes. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that with the implementation of appropriate limitations and safety constraints, AI systems can be directed to produce outputs that are aligned with safety objectives. This controllability is a key factor in ensuring that AI systems operate within safe parameters. 

Furthermore, the advancements in AI are paralleled by significant progress in the safety measures and frameworks that govern their deployment. For example, GPT-4's capacity to adhere to given rules has improved compared to its predecessor, indicating a trend towards safer and more reliable systems. The integration of AI with traditional logic-based systems, like the partnership between OpenAI and Wolfram Alpha, exemplifies a promising direction for developing AI that is robust and predictable. This approach aligns the underlying intelligence of AI with a knowledge base that is well-understood and verified, allowing for more reliable and predictable behavior.

International guidelines and regulations, such as those proposed by the OECD and the forthcoming European Union AI Act, emphasize the necessity for AI systems to be robust, predictable, and demonstrably safe before deployment, especially in high-stakes scenarios. These frameworks are not advocating for a moratorium but are enforcing a standard that ensures AI systems do not present undue risk.

In summary, the safety of AI is not a byproduct of limiting their capabilities but is achieved through strategic design and oversight. The objective-driven AI systems that are being developed are designed with safety constraints that ensure their outputs are controlled and aligned with our safety goals. As such, the deployment of AI systems in real-world applications can be made safe, provided that the necessary safety objectives are implemented and enforced. As we continue to refine these systems and their corresponding safety measures, we can move towards a future where AI contributes positively to our society, mitigating risks and maximizing benefits.
