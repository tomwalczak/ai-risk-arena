2. Argument of Epistemic Humility, Empirical Adjustability, and Rigorous Testing in AI Risk Assessment

The approach to evaluating and mitigating the risks associated with artificial intelligence is grounded in a scientific methodology that values epistemic humility and empirical adjustability. This method acknowledges our own limitations in knowledge and allows for the revision of beliefs and strategies in light of new evidence. Rather than being static, our understanding of AI risks is dynamic and constantly evolving, subject to refinement as new data emerges.

We identify risks that are not abstract fears but concrete and falsifiable. For instance, concerns about AI systems exhibiting unforeseen behaviors or engaging in reward hacking are addressed through stringent, iterative testing and cautious, step-by-step implementation. This incremental approach to deployment allows for continuous assessment and adjustment, ensuring that AI systems can be safely integrated into various sectors.

Consider the analogy to the financial system: its complexity and the unpredictable nature of its failures were highlighted during the 2008 crisis. Similarly, AI is a complex system with potential for unexpected failures, yet this complexity does not render it uncontrollable. By applying rigorous testing and learning from interdisciplinary experiences, such as those in complex financial systems, we can enhance the reliability and safety of AI technologies.

Moreover, we must avoid the pitfalls of overestimating certain risks due to speculative scenarios, mirroring historical misallocations of concern, such as the fears of running out of petroleum in the 1970s. The focus should remain on evidence-based risks rather than hypothetical dangers that divert attention and resources from pressing issues.

In parallel, we can draw parallels to other domains of scientific advancement, such as vaccinations, which despite speculative risks, have proven to be overwhelmingly beneficial. Similarly, AI holds immense potential to revolutionize science, healthcare, and education. To stifle its development based on unsupported existential threats would be akin to rejecting the benefits of scientific progress because of the potential dangers. Instead, our assessments should be rooted in empirical data and scientific rigor to ensure that we harness the benefits of AI while effectively managing its risks.
