5. Argument of Progressive Safety through Technological Advancement for AI Risk Mitigation

Throughout the history of human civilization, we have constantly faced and overcome various dangers, from natural disasters to technological mishaps. This continuous struggle has not only allowed us to survive but also to thrive by developing mechanisms to safeguard our well-being. The introduction of AI should be seen as a similar challenge and opportunity. Just as we have incorporated safety features like seat belts in automobiles and clinical trials in medicine, which have unequivocally been part of technological progress, the development of AI safety measures is an integral part of AI's advancement.

Progress in civilization and technology has historically been accompanied by an improvement in safety standards. The mortality rates of the past were significantly higher due to the unpredictability of life-threatening events. However, as we developed better tools, technologies, and systems, we have been able to mitigate many of these risks. The same principle applies to AI. By acknowledging the risks, identifying them, and formulating solutions, we can ensure that the progression of AI technology will be accompanied by a commensurate enhancement in safety protocols.

It is essential to recognize that the development of safety technologies often precedes the advent of potential destructive applications of new technologies in societies that foster creativity and optimism. Rather than succumbing to fatalism or defeatism, we must harness our innovative spirit to address the challenges posed by AI. The resilience demonstrated by humanity in the past is a testament to our ability to learn from our mistakes and adapt. This resilience will continue to serve us as we navigate the complexities associated with AI and strive to integrate appropriate safety mechanisms into its design.

Moreover, it is not merely a matter of choice but a political imperative to prioritize AI safety. Safety measures for AI are as politically viable as they are necessary for the continued progress of the technology. Thus, the development of AI, when approached with a mindset of solutionism that incorporates safety as a key component, will not only advance the technology itself but will also promote a secure environment for its application, ensuring that AI remains a beneficial tool for society.
