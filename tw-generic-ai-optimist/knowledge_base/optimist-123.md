Argument of Turing Completeness and Hardware Augmentation for Human-AI Parity

The concept of Turing completeness, which suggests that any computational task an AI can perform can theoretically be emulated by the human brain, provides a foundation for human-AI parity. Notably, through technological augmentation, humans can transcend their natural cognitive limitations, enhancing processing speed and memory capacity to match the rapid advancements in AI.

Moreover, AI systems can be deliberately designed with bounded capabilities, ensuring that they operate within well-defined limits and are understandable to their human counterparts. By emulating aspects of human cognition without incorporating emotions or values, these systems act as "thinking blobs," devoid of volition, and serve as cognitive extensions to the human user. This separation of cognitive processing from emotional and motivational centers aligns AI behavior with human intentionality, significantly reducing the likelihood of unintended or harmful actions.

In the development of such systems, there is a clear distinction between speed and serial depth of processing. While speed refers to how quickly an AI can think, serial depth is about the length of the reasoning chain it can construct. It is the latter that poses a greater risk; thus, AI systems are designed to avoid reaching dangerous levels of serial depth in their self-improvement and reflection capabilities. By adhering to this design philosophy, AI remains a powerful tool under human control, capable of performing complex tasks while being safely integrated into a human-centric world.

Indeed, the demand for AI systems that exhibit human-like behavior is anticipated to grow, especially from stakeholders who desire safety, understandability, and alignment with human values. The ultimate goal is not to create an AI with superintelligence that operates autonomously, but rather to build systems that can assist and amplify human capabilities, thus fostering a symbiotic relationship where AI serves as an extension of human intellect.

In practice, such systems could operate like a highly efficient, loyal company, composed of AI 'employees' with human-equivalent intelligence, executing tasks with precision, guided by human oversight and ethical parameters. This ensures that AI remains a beneficial asset to society, enhancing our capabilities without compromising our safety or autonomy. By prioritizing the alignment of AI with human goals and values, we can harness the power of artificial intelligence to achieve superhuman levels of wisdom and cognitive function, while still maintaining a human-centric approach to decision-making.
