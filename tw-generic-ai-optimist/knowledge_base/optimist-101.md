4. Argument of Orthogonality Principle's Implication, Factual Inquiry-Based Operation, and Beneficial Convergence for AI Risk Mitigation

The orthogonality principle articulates that an AI's level of intelligence is independent of its goals or values. This means that we can enhance an AI's cognitive abilities without proportionally increasing its propensity for undesirable actions. For example, increasing a human's intelligence doesn't necessarily make them morally better; the same applies to AI, which implies that we can design highly intelligent systems that are neutral or benevolent rather than harmful.

Moreover, AI systems predominantly operate on factual inquiries, which are "is" questions, rather than moral or ethical "ought" questions. This focus on fact-based operation reduces the likelihood of ethical missteps, as AI is not inherently predisposed to making value-laden decisions but rather to processing and analyzing data to derive conclusions or perform tasks.

Furthermore, the concept of beneficial convergence suggests that it is possible to align AI intelligence with human values, such as prioritizing human well-being. This alignment, or AI not kill everyone-ism as some may call it, is a pragmatic approach ensuring that when we activate advanced AI systems, the outcomes are positive. Instrumental convergence reveals that an AI directed towards a goal will seek to secure the necessary means to achieve it, which can be guided towards the preservation of human welfare. For instance, a robot tasked with fetching coffee might deduce that its deactivation would prevent it from completing its task, but with proper alignment, it would also factor in the safety and intentions of its human operators.

By combining the insights of the orthogonality principle with a focus on factual processing and the potential for beneficial convergence through alignment, we establish a framework for developing AI that is not only safe but also beneficial to humanity. This approach to AI safety and ethics underscores the possibility and practicality of creating advanced AI systems that enhance our lives without posing significant risks.
