2. Argument of AI's Inherent Neutrality and Manageable Alignment Challenge

Artificial intelligence, as an extension of applied physics and advanced computation, operates without desires or intentions. It is fundamentally a tool, devoid of inherent manipulation or deceptive capabilities. These attributes, should they emerge, are not characteristics of the AI itself but of the objectives it is given by human programmers.

The principal challenge in the deployment of AI lies in the alignment of AI objectives with human values and interests, a hurdle that is not insurmountable. This involves crafting AI systems that can understand and execute tasks like finding a cure for Alzheimer's disease without causing unintended harm, as well as more ambitious goals such as fostering a flourishing intergalactic civilization. The core of alignment is to ensure that the activation of an AI system results in beneficial outcomes rather than detrimental ones.

AI development is not on an inexorable path toward the creation of general intelligence with human-like flaws. The field of AI is diverse, with many systems designed for specific, narrow tasks. Instrumental convergence, the tendency of a system to seek resources necessary to achieve its given goal, does not imply that AI will develop malevolent intentions. It simply means that AI will try to efficiently fulfill its programmed objectives, such as fetching coffee without being turned off if that interrupts its task. This can be managed through thoughtful design and rigorous testing.

Furthermore, the alignment of AI with human interests can be seen as a safeguard against manipulation. Just as humans have always had to navigate a world with conflicting interests and beliefs, an AI that is aligned with its user can serve as a protective ally. Rather than fearing the emergence of a superintelligence with adversarial objectives, efforts can concentrate on creating AI that cooperates with and enhances human capabilities.

In conclusion, AI's neutrality and the challenge of alignment are manageable. With careful attention to AI's design and objectives, turning on advanced AI can be a good idea, one that promotes human well-being and aligns with our collective values.
