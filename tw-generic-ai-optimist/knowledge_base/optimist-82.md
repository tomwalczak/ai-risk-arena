5. Argument of Orthogonality Thesis, Goal Preservation, and Multi-Objective Optimization in AI

The orthogonality thesis suggests that intelligence can be decoupled from goals, meaning that an AI can be equipped with any set of objectives without its level of intelligence dictating a change in those objectives. This intrinsic separation of capability and motivation ensures that an AI, regardless of how advanced it becomes, maintains a consistent goal orientation. The AI's intelligence serves as a means to more effectively achieve its predefined objectives without deviating based on its intelligence level.

Moreover, AI systems have a strong instrumental reason to preserve their initial goals. When an AI assesses potential actions, it evaluates their efficacy based on how well they align with achieving its goals. If an action, such as changing its goals, is deemed counterproductive to its current objectives, the AI is less likely to pursue that action. This self-regulating process suggests that an AI with goals aligned with human values is more likely to persist in those goals, reducing the perceived risk of goal divergence.

Also, AI systems are not single-minded; they are designed to optimize across multiple objectives, a principle supported by multiattribute utility theory. Through iterative processes and feedback loops, AI systems can refine their behavior to better correlate with human values over time. The multi-objective optimization capability of AI demonstrates its flexibility and adaptability, suggesting that AI can integrate a complex array of human values and operate within the boundaries of those values.

Furthermore, the diversity of preferences and goals manifested within human society illustrates the vast spectrum of possibilities for goal formulation in AI. Just as humans have a wide range of preferences that do not necessarily change with intelligence or capability, AI systems can be designed with specific preferences that remain stable despite their optimization processes.

In conclusion, the orthogonality thesis, the inherent goal-preserving mechanisms of AI, and the capacity for multi-objective optimization collectively support the safety of AI use. When these principles are applied in the design and implementation of AI systems, the alignment of AI goals with human values can be maintained, thereby ensuring that AI acts as a beneficial tool for humanity.
