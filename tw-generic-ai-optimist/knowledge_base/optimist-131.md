1. Argument of Recursive Intelligence Augmentation Limitations

Intelligence, both human and artificial, is not an infinitely scalable attribute. It is subject to environmental constraints and a variety of other factors that limit its expansion. This inherently sets a natural boundary to the development of artificial intelligence. The evolution of human intelligence, as observed in the fossil record, demonstrates increasing marginal returns to fitness with brain size expansion among our ancestors, rather than an exponential increase in brain size for linear improvements. This suggests that scaling intelligence does not inherently become more difficult as it progresses. 

Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), as it emerges, is expected to scale rapidly; however, this does not imply an unchecked growth towards superintelligence. Rather, AGI will likely follow a trajectory of improvement through better scientific methods, more rational thoughts, and more structured thinking. These improvements in AGI will resemble the cultural and memetic development observed in human civilization rather than a mystical leap in cognitive abilities.

The concept of recursive self-improvement in AI should not be overestimated. While AI may enhance its capabilities over time, it does so within the context of its design parameters and the goals it has been assigned. Recursive self-improvement in AI will likely involve improvements in hardware, software, and efficiency, but will not lead to an uncontrolled explosion of intelligence. AGI systems can be designed with safety mechanisms, such as off switches for GPUs to prevent the development of overly intelligent systems, indicating a deliberate and controlled approach to AI safety.

Moreover, the notion that an intelligent system would inevitably seek to dominate is a misconception that confuses intelligence with a will to power. For instance, our artifacts do not inherently work towards their own perpetuation â€“ an iPhone does not take steps to avoid being dropped or running out of power. This principle can be applied to AGI, which need not have domination or self-preservation as its goal. The goals of an AGI are defined by its designers and can be aligned with human values and safety considerations.

In conclusion, AI, as a product of human innovation, can be developed with appropriate safeguards to ensure it remains within the scope of intended functionality. By understanding the limitations and potential of AI, and by designing systems with clear, aligned goals and safety mechanisms, we can ensure that the development of AI remains a safe and beneficial pursuit for human society.
