3. Argument of Legal Liability, Incentives for Risk Mitigation, and Solvable Alignment Problem

The establishment of clear legal liability for the deployment and use of artificial intelligence systems can serve as a powerful incentive for companies to prioritize the safety and reliability of their AI. When accountability is enforced, companies become more diligent, employing advanced technical tools and protocols to minimize potential risks associated with AI. This dedication to safety can be further encouraged through a system of fines and penalties for those who do not adhere to established safety standards, effectively balancing the cost of non-compliance against the benefits of AI utilization.

Furthermore, collaboration between governments and leading AI corporations could play a crucial role in mitigating risks. The concerted effort to align incentives with safe practices ensures that at every step of AI development and deployment, stakeholders are motivated to act in the best interest of public safety. This structured alignment of incentives is not only rational but also feasible, as evidenced by historical precedents where industries have successfully navigated the introduction of transformative technologies by adapting regulations and establishing cooperative frameworks.

The technical challenge of ensuring that AI systems' goals are aligned with human values and safety requirements—the alignment problem—is indeed complex, but not beyond the realms of possibility. The notion of an international institution analogous to CERN for AI, facilitating a broad coalition of countries to provide input and guidance, is a testament to the potential of collective human ingenuity in steering AI development responsibly. Such an institution could ensure that AI advances do not become monopolized and that their benefits are distributed equitably, without posing undue risks to society.

In essence, the legal, cooperative, and technical strategies under discussion form a socio-technical approach to making AI safe. They recognize that the safety of AI is not solely a technical issue to be solved in isolation, but rather a multifaceted challenge that spans political, economic, and social dimensions. By understanding and shaping the incentives and structures within which AI developers operate, we can ensure that AI advances in a manner that is not only innovative but also secure and beneficial for all of humanity.
