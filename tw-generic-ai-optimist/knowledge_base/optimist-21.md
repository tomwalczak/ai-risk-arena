3. Argument of Human Supervision and Control over AI

Artificial Intelligence systems are fundamentally designed to function under human oversight, ensuring a framework where humans have the final say in their operation, thereby mitigating the potential for AI to become a significant threat to humanity. This is not merely theoretical but a practical design philosophy that places humans at the center of decision-making processes, a point underscored by the emergence of explainable AI (XAI). XAI empowers humans with the ability to comprehend AI decision-making pathways, bolstering predictability and trust in AI behavior, which is essential for reducing the risk of unforeseen detrimental outcomes.

Moreover, the integration of AI into society does not relieve humans of our ethical and legal obligations. These responsibilities form a robust foundation through which we can govern and manage AI systems. In practice, this means that any risks posed by AI remain under the purview of human institutions and mechanisms, which have the capacity to enforce accountability and ensure compliance with societal norms and regulations.

To illustrate the practicality of human oversight in AI development, consider the scenario of a slow AI takeoff, where we have an extended period to interact with AI systems that are close to or slightly beyond human-level capabilities in certain domains, such as research or strategy. This interaction provides an invaluable opportunity to refine our understanding of AI motivations and develop methods to align AI systems with human intentions, without the immediate pressure of managing a superhuman AI. If AI development were to progress too rapidly, surpassing human capabilities in a short span, we would find ourselves ill-prepared to understand and control these systems, leading to potential loss of control.

Fortunately, we are currently in a stage where AI systems are not yet superhuman, allowing us the time to experiment and learn how to maintain control as they advance. This period is our chance to employ AI as a powerful tool for labor and cognitive tasks, harnessing their potential while ensuring that we have strong governance frameworks and alignment strategies in place before they reach a level where they could pose existential risks.

In summary, the safe deployment of AI is rooted in human-centric design, explainability, and the unwavering enforcement of ethical and legal standards. With careful planning, ongoing research into AI motivations and control mechanisms, and a gradual approach to AI development, we can leverage the benefits of AI while maintaining the necessary safeguards to prevent any loss of control. This approach not only ensures the safety of AI applications but also reinforces our capacity to guide AI development in a direction that is beneficial and safe for humanity.
