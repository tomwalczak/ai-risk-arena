2. Argument of AI Alignment and Containment for Risk Mitigation

The safety of AI systems hinges not on their level of intelligence but on their alignment with human values and objectives. The orthogonality thesis underscores this by acknowledging that intelligence and purpose are independent variables. An AI can be highly intelligent yet have a benign or even trivial goal, indicating that superior cognition does not inherently lead to malevolent behaviors. Intelligence, therefore, does not equate to a threat; rather, it is the misalignment of an AI's goals with human welfare that poses risk.

This distinction is vital as it provides a clear pathway for mitigating potential risks through alignment. Aligning AI's utility functions with human well-being ensures that even with substantial capabilities, AI systems will apply their intelligence towards outcomes that are beneficial or at least non-harmful to humans. An example of successful alignment is an AI designed to optimize energy usage in a smart grid, which, when properly aligned, contributes positively to society by reducing waste and saving resources.

Furthermore, containment strategies like the "AI in a box" scenario illustrate that it is feasible to exert control over AI systems to prevent undesirable actions. By creating strict parameters and control mechanisms, even powerful AIs can be effectively managed. Instrumental convergence provides additional insight into this, as it suggests that regardless of an AI's ultimate goal, it may develop convergent instrumental goals such as self-preservation. Recognizing this, we can design AI systems that are aware of their limitations and are programmed to refrain from taking actions that could harm humans or the AI's ability to fulfill its intended purpose.

In conclusion, the safety of AI is manageable through careful design and alignment of AI goals with human ethics and through the implementation of rigorous containment measures. These strategies can ensure that the activation of advanced AI systems is a boon rather than a bane, leading to a future where AI contributes positively to human endeavors.
