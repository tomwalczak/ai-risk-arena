Argument of Empirical Evidence and Formal Models in AI Development

Advancements in machine learning empower researchers to experiment and address challenges like accurately specifying rewards in learning systems and preventing models from gaming these rewards. These empirical explorations supplement the theoretical aspects of AI, grounding the field in observable, measurable realities rather than solely on speculative thought. By integrating empirical data with rigorous formal mathematical models, AI development rests on a foundation that is both observable and provably correct.

Formal models in AI extend beyond abstract concepts, incorporating mathematical proofs and guarantees that bolster the safety and reliability of AI systems. The use of formal logic in AI, with roots traceable to ancient philosophers like Aristotle, has evolved to capture aspects of human reasoning through computational representations. The sophistication of these models has grown, particularly with the introduction of reasoning under uncertainty and the refinement of causality, as seen in Judea Pearl's work. This historical and methodical approach to AI development showcases a continuous and systematic effort to ensure that AI systems are safe for use.

Moreover, the architecture of AI systems is designed with intrinsic information processes and data representation formats, some of which are hardwired and not learned through experience. This fundamental structure permits the inclusion of variables for objects, minds, living things, or artifacts, which, though it may vary from human cognitive processes, remains an empirical question. AI systems like AlphaGo demonstrate capabilities that, while distinct from human cognition, exhibit a remarkable understanding of complex tasks without human-like deliberation, further illustrating AI's potential to operate safely within its designed parameters.

The use of AI is not a blind march towards increased computational power. It is a deliberate, cautious exploration of what it means to be intelligentâ€”both humanly and artificially. While scaling up deep learning systems is a current trend, AI researchers recognize that human intelligence navigates complexity through a diverse array of cognitive processes that AI does not yet emulate. This recognition of the gap between human and artificial intelligence implies a cautious, responsible approach to AI development, ensuring systems are safe and aligned with their intended functions.

In this context, AI safety is not an afterthought but a primary concern addressed through empirical data, formal models, and the understanding that AI systems do not have to mimic human cognition to be considered safe. Instead, they must demonstrate consistent, reliable performance within their defined scope of operation, backed by rigorous testing and validation. The careful and methodical progression of AI, informed by empirical evidence and governed by formal models, provides a high level of confidence in the safety and reliability of AI systems, making them fit for use in an array of applications.
