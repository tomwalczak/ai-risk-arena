claim: "Human civilization has been getting progressively safer throughout history."
premises:
  - claim: "Historical events such as plagues and potential asteroid impacts posed existential threats in the past but advancements have reduced these threats."
  - claim: "Despite the ability to make catastrophic mistakes, humanity lacks the technology to end civilization entirely, indicating increased safety."
counterargument_to:
  - "Human civilization is facing greater dangers than ever before due to modern technology and global challenges."
  - "The advancement of technology, especially in areas like AI and nuclear arms, increases the likelihood of accidental or intentional existential threats."
  - "Historical progress does not guarantee future safety, as new, unprecedented risks emerge with technological and societal advancements."

strongest_objection:
  - "The same technological advancements that provide solutions also introduce new and potentially uncontrollable risks, such as AI or bioengineered pathogens, that could pose existential threats to humanity."
  - "Human error, malintent, or oversight in managing complex systems could lead to catastrophic outcomes, undermining the argument that we are necessarily safer."

consequences_if_true:
  - "Humanity can focus more on leveraging technological advancements for further reducing risks rather than being paralyzed by fear of existential threats."
  - "Policymaking can be informed by optimism and evidence of historical progress in reducing existential risks, leading to more balanced and forward-thinking approaches."
  - "Investments in science, technology, and global cooperation become even more justified as means to continue the trend of increasing safety."

link_to_ai_safety: This argument underscores the importance of responsible AI development as a continuation of humanity's historical trend towards safer living conditions.

simple_explanation: Throughout history, humanity has faced numerous existential threats, from plagues to asteroid impacts, yet we have consistently overcome these challenges through advancements in science and technology. Despite the introduction of new technologies that could potentially be misused, our track record shows a clear trend towards increasing safety. We lack the technology to end civilization entirely, suggesting that even with our capacity for catastrophic mistakes, there will always be paths to recovery and lessons to be learned, leading to even safer futures.

examples:
  - The development of vaccines and medical treatments that have drastically reduced the threat of diseases that once decimated populations.
  - The establishment of international treaties and early warning systems that mitigate the risks of nuclear war and asteroid impacts.
  - The advancements in food production and distribution technologies that have reduced the risk of famines, which historically posed significant threats to human civilizations.
