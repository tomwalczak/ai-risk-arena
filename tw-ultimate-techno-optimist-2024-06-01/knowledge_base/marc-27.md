link_to_ai_safety: Ensuring AI's affordability and accessibility is crucial for preventing a future where AI technology exacerbates social and economic divides, contributing to a safer integration of AI into society.

simple_explanation:
Imagine a world where every new tech gadget and service becomes cheaper and more accessible with time. This isn't just wishful thinking; it's a trend we've seen with many technologies, from cars to computers. Now, apply this to AI. The creators of AI want everyone to use their products, not just a select few. Over time, they make their AI tools more affordable, so more people can use them, just like Tesla did with electric cars. This means that AI could actually help bridge the gap between the rich and poor by becoming a tool everyone can use, not just something that makes the rich richer.

examples:
  - Elon Musk's Tesla strategy, which aimed to make electric cars accessible to the broader public.
  - The evolution of personal computers, which transitioned from expensive, exclusive devices to affordable, essential tools for the majority of households.
  - Mobile phones, especially smartphones, have become widely accessible and affordable, significantly impacting global communication and access to information.
