claim: "Current surveillance proposals for AI safety are inadequate due to emerging training techniques and architectures."
premises:
  - claim: "New training methods involve chaining together small, highly capable models, potentially evading compute thresholds for surveillance."
    example: "Approaches like Sakana AI and the HuggingGPT paper's proposal."
  - claim: "Breakthroughs in training AI with minimal data could make existing surveillance methods obsolete."
counterargument_to:
  - Current surveillance proposals are sufficient for ensuring AI safety across various training techniques and architectures.

strongest_objjection:
  - These emerging training techniques and architectures might still exhibit detectable patterns or behaviors that enable effective surveillance without relying on compute thresholds.

consequences_if_true:
  - Surveillance frameworks would need to be significantly redesigned to accommodate the detection and monitoring of chained, smaller AI models.
  - Regulatory and oversight mechanisms might fail to detect or intervene in potentially harmful AI developments in a timely manner.
  - The gap between AI capabilities and our ability to ensure their safety could widen, increasing risks of misuse or unintended consequences.

link_to_ai_safety: This argument highlights the potential for current AI surveillance methods to be outpaced by novel training approaches, raising concerns about our ability to maintain AI safety.

simple_explanation: The current methods used to keep an eye on AI development might not be up to scratch anymore because of new ways of training AI. For example, by using smaller, but very smart AI models that work together, or by teaching AI to learn a lot from a little bit of data, we could end up with AI that's hard to monitor with the old rules. This means we might not catch when AI starts doing things it shouldn't, making it harder to keep AI safe and under control.

examples:
  - Sakana AI's approach to training highly capable small models that can be chained together, possibly evading traditional surveillance based on computing power.
  - The HuggingGPT paper's proposal for extending GPT-4 by selecting smaller models for completing complex tasks, representing a shift towards more modular AI systems.
  - Research suggesting AI can be trained with minimal data, potentially reducing the visibility of its development to current surveillance mechanisms.
