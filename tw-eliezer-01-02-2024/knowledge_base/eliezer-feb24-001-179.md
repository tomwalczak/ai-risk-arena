claim: "Possibility does not equal probability when considering the future of AI and humanity."
premises:
  - claim: "The existence of a technical possibility for safe AI development does not mean the world will necessarily adapt to allow for it."
  - claim: "Current global actions and trajectory are not aligned with taking the necessary steps for safe AI development."
counterargument_to:
  - The belief that just because we can technically develop safe AI means we will do so, and thus, we shouldn't worry too much about the risks.

strongest_objection:
  - Some may argue that human adaptability and technological ingenuity have historically overcome great challenges, suggesting we could align global actions towards safe AI development when necessary.

consequences_if_true:
  - If the argument holds true, it implies that simply having the technical know-how for safe AI development is insufficient without global cooperation and action.
  - There might be a false sense of security regarding AI safety, leading to inadequate preparation and potentially catastrophic outcomes.
  - The gap between possibility and probability might widen, making it more challenging to ensure AI's safe integration into society.

link_to_ai_safety: This argument highlights the critical distinction between the potential for safe AI development and the actual likelihood of achieving it, underlining the importance of proactive global measures for AI safety.

simple_explanation: Just because we have the know-how to develop AI safely doesn't guarantee we'll manage to do it. Our current global trajectory doesn't align with the necessary steps for this safe development, meaning there's a real risk that despite knowing how to avoid dangers, we might fail to do so. This isn't just about inventing safety measures; it's about the world coming together to implement them effectively, and right now, we're falling short.

examples:
  - The development of nuclear energy presented both the possibility of clean power and the probability of catastrophic weapons, but global actions (or lack thereof) influenced the actual outcomes.
  - Despite knowing the dangers of climate change and possible interventions, the world has struggled to align actions with the necessary steps to effectively combat it.
  - The invention of antibiotics was a technical possibility that revolutionized medicine, but without global cooperation on antimicrobial resistance, we face the probability of entering a post-antibiotic era.
