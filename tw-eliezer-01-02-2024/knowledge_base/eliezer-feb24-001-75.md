claim: "There's no counter-evidence that smart enough humans will opt for alternatives to DNA if offered a sufficiently better option."
premises:
  - claim: "In this discussion, both participants acknowledge they would choose an alternative to DNA if it were better."
  - claim: "The hypothetical resistance to such a choice exists only as a conjecture in our discussion, not evidenced in reality."
counterargument_to:
  - The argument that humans inherently value DNA so much that they would resist replacing it with an alternative, even if a better option were available.

strongest_objection:
  - Some might argue that the deep biological and emotional connection to DNA and the process of natural reproduction is underestimated, leading to potential resistance to alternatives not fully accounted for in this argument.

consequences_if_true:
  - If humans are open to alternatives to DNA when presented with a sufficiently better option, it could lead to significant advancements in genetic engineering and artificial life forms.
  - This openness could accelerate the development of new forms of life or intelligence that surpass biological limitations.
  - Ethical and societal frameworks would need to evolve rapidly to address the implications of such significant changes to human reproduction and genetics.

link_to_ai_safety: This discussion underscores the importance of considering human adaptability and decision-making in the development of advanced technologies, including AI, to ensure they are aligned with human values.

simple_explanation: The argument presented suggests that humans, when offered a significantly better alternative to DNA for reproduction or life creation, would likely embrace it, based on the evidence of human adaptability and the lack of concrete resistance to such changes in reality. This perspective challenges the notion that there is an inherent, unchangeable value placed on DNA, instead proposing that humans are pragmatic and open to enhancements that offer clear benefits, reflecting a broader willingness to evolve beyond biological constraints.

examples:
  - The widespread acceptance and integration of medical technologies like IVF (In Vitro Fertilization) indicate a willingness to embrace non-traditional methods of reproduction when they offer solutions to existing challenges.
  - The concept of digital or artificial life forms in science fiction becoming more accepted and seriously considered by the public and researchers alike as technology advances.
  - The rapid adaptation to and integration of revolutionary technologies (e.g., the internet, smartphones) into daily life, showing the human propensity to adopt and normalize technologies that offer significant improvements to lifestyle and capabilities.
