claim: "There is no pivotal output of an AGI that is humanly checkable and can safely save the world."
premises:
  - claim: "Significant AGI actions leverage unknown world aspects, making outcomes unpredictable for humans."
  - claim: "A fully comprehensible and predictable AGI action sequence would indicate an intelligence inferior to human capabilities."
counterargument_to:
  - "AGI can produce pivotal outcomes that humans can understand, verify, and safely implement to save the world."

strongest_objection:
  - "Humans have historically managed to harness complex tools and systems they initially did not fully understand, through iterative learning and adaptation."

consequences_if_true:
  - "Reliance on AGI for pivotal, world-saving actions could lead to unpredictable and potentially catastrophic outcomes due to our inability to fully comprehend and control these actions."
  - "This would necessitate a new approach to AI safety focused on developing AGIs whose decision-making processes are inherently aligned with human values and comprehensible to humans."
  - "It may limit the scope of tasks that AGIs are allowed to autonomously undertake, focusing on those where outcomes can be predicted and controlled."

link_to_ai_safety: This argument underscores the critical need for AI systems that are not only aligned with human values but also whose actions can be fully understood and predicted by humans.

simple_explanation: If an artificial general intelligence (AGI) comes up with a plan to save the world, it's likely because it understands something we don't. If we could fully predict the outcomes of its actions, that would mean the AGI isn't really smarter than us. Since we can't know everything an AGI might know, we can't safely check all its plans to ensure they won't have any dangerous side effects. This means we can't rely on just checking an AGI's plans to keep us safe; we need to make sure its way of thinking is aligned with ours from the start.

examples:
  - "The introduction of nuclear energy presented a situation where humans harnessed a powerful new tool without fully understanding all its potential consequences, illustrating the risks of using complex systems."
  - "The development of the internet revolutionized information sharing and communication but also led to unforeseen challenges such as data privacy issues and cybercrime."
  - "The rapid advancement in genetic engineering technologies offers great potential benefits but also poses significant ethical and safety concerns due to the unpredictability of long-term biological impacts."
