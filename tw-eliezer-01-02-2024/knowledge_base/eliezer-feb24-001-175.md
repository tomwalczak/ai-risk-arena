claim: "The likelihood of humanity effectively pursuing and executing an AI safety strategy that includes shutting down dangerous AI developments is not very high."
premises:
  - claim: "Serious conversations about shutting down risky AI development might follow significant public outcry."
  - claim: "The implementation of a safe exit strategy following the shutdown of dangerous AI developments is uncertain."
counterargument_to:
  - "Humanity can quickly and effectively respond to the dangers of AI by simply shutting down or pausing risky AI developments."

strongest_objjection:
  - "A shutdown of AI development could also inadvertently halt AI safety research, potentially leaving us more vulnerable to AI risks when development resumes."

consequences_if_true:
  - "Pausing or shutting down risky AI development might not effectively mitigate AI risks and could delay important safety research."
  - "The lack of clear implementation for a safe exit strategy could lead to chaotic or ineffective responses to AI dangers."
  - "Public outcry as a trigger for action might result in hasty, poorly thought-out decisions rather than deliberate, informed strategies."

link_to_ai_safety: This argument highlights the complexities and potential pitfalls in developing and implementing strategies for AI safety.

simple_explanation: The idea that humanity can simply shut down dangerous AI developments to ensure safety is overly optimistic. Serious discussions about such actions are likely to occur only after widespread public concern, and even then, the path to safely ending these developments is fraught with uncertainty. Furthermore, halting AI research could inadvertently stop progress on AI safety as well, leaving us unprepared to handle AI risks in the future. This underscores the need for careful, proactive planning in AI development and safety measures.

examples:
  - "The pause on general AI research during the AI winters did not necessarily lead to safer AI technologies afterward; it just delayed progress."
  - "Reactions to the Cambridge Analytica scandal led to calls for pausing certain types of data analysis, which did not necessarily lead to safer data practices but rather to widespread confusion and slowdown."
  - "Nuclear energy development faced significant public outcry leading to shutdowns or pauses in several countries, which did not always result in safer nuclear technology but sometimes in a lack of progress on safety measures."
