claim: "Enhancing human intelligence is a safer path than developing superintelligent AI"
premises:
  - claim: "Alignment of AI with human values will not be solved in the near future"
  - claim: "Human intelligence enhancement has a chance of success, offering a safer alternative"
counterargument_to:
  - "Developing superintelligent AI is the most effective path to advancing our technological and intellectual capabilities."
  - "Superintelligent AI can solve problems beyond human comprehension, making it a priority over enhancing human intelligence."

strongest_objection:
  - "Enhancing human intelligence could exacerbate existing inequalities and lead to new forms of discrimination or conflict."

consequences_if_true:
  - "Focusing on human intelligence enhancement may lead to more balanced technological advancement, aligning more closely with human values."
  - "It could foster a safer approach to the existential risks posed by AI, as enhanced humans might better manage and control AI development."
  - "There might be a significant reduction in the race towards unaligned superintelligent AI, decreasing the likelihood of catastrophic outcomes."

link_to_ai_safety: Enhancing human intelligence as a priority over developing superintelligent AI directly addresses the core concern of AI safety by potentially providing more reliable oversight and alignment with human values.

simple_explanation: If we accept that aligning AI with human values is a complex challenge unlikely to be solved soon, and acknowledge that enhancing human intelligence could be successfully achieved, then focusing on making people smarter becomes a safer, more promising path. This approach could help us navigate the risks associated with superintelligent AI by ensuring that our technological advancements are more in harmony with human interests and ethics. It's about steering the future in a direction where we can manage and understand the technologies we create, rather than being outpaced by them.

examples:
  - "Cognitive enhancements through safe and ethical neurotechnology could lead to a society where individuals are better equipped to understand and solve complex problems."
  - "Genetic modifications aimed at increasing intelligence, if successful and ethically managed, could contribute to a future where human capacities are significantly expanded."
  - "Investing in education and cognitive development programs on a global scale to elevate the collective human intellect and problem-solving abilities."
