claim: "Relying on future AI alignment and safety research for survival requires a significant change from current trends."
premises:
  - claim: "AI capabilities have outpaced alignment research so far."
  - claim: "Survival depending on alignment necessitates either slowing AI capability gains or greatly accelerating alignment research."
counterargument_to:
  - "We can continue developing AI capabilities without significantly changing our approach to AI alignment and safety research."

strongest_objjection:
  - "Slowing down AI capability gains might stifle innovation and economic growth, potentially causing more harm than good."

consequences_if_true:
  - If AI capabilities continue to outpace alignment research, we risk developing powerful AI systems that we cannot control or ensure are safe.
  - Prioritizing alignment research or slowing down capability gains could lead to safer development of AI, preventing potential catastrophic outcomes.
  - A significant change in approach could foster a more collaborative and globally coordinated effort in AI safety and alignment research.

link_to_ai_safety: This argument underscores the critical link between the pace of AI capability gains and the necessity of alignment research to ensure AI safety.

simple_explanation: To ensure that future AI systems do not pose a risk to humanity, we must either slow down the development of AI capabilities or significantly speed up research into making these AI systems align with human values and safety standards. So far, the rapid progress in AI capabilities has not been matched by similar progress in alignment research, indicating a dangerous imbalance. If we continue on this path without changing our approach, we might reach a point where controlling or ensuring the safety of AI systems could be beyond our capabilities. Prioritizing alignment research now is crucial for our survival.

examples:
  - The development of GPT models by OpenAI shows rapid advancements in capabilities, while the discourse around their alignment and safety lags behind.
  - Historical technological races, such as nuclear weapons development, highlight the dangers of prioritizing capability gains without sufficient safety measures.
  - The slow response to climate change demonstrates the consequences of ignoring alignment between technological/environmental impact and global safety priorities.
