claim: "Reading about AI alignment cannot transform someone into a core researcher."
premises:
  - claim: "Core researchers can spontaneously generate original thoughts on AI alignment."
  - claim: "This ability is rare, even among current field workers."
counterargument_to:
  - "Reading extensively about AI alignment is sufficient for becoming a core researcher in the field."
  - "Theoretical knowledge alone can qualify someone as an expert in AI alignment."

strongest_objjection:
  - "Comprehensive reading and understanding of AI alignment literature could significantly contribute to one's ability to innovate and contribute original thoughts to the field."

consequences_if_true:
  - It would imply that practical experience and the ability to innovate are crucial in becoming a core researcher in AI alignment.
  - It may lead to a reassessment of how experts in the field are defined and how new researchers are trained.
  - It could encourage a more hands-on, experimental approach to learning and research in AI alignment.

link_to_ai_safety: This argument underscores the importance of practical experience and innovative thinking in ensuring AI systems align with human values and ethics.

simple_explanation: Even if you read everything there is about AI alignment, that doesn't make you a core researcher in the field. Core researchers aren't just well-read; they have a rare ability to come up with original ideas and solutions. This kind of creativity and innovation isn't something you can get from books alone; it comes from hands-on experience and a deep, intuitive understanding of the subject. So, being a true expert in AI alignment means more than just knowing what others have thought and written; it requires contributing new, original insights to the field.

examples:
  - A musician can study music theory extensively, but without composing or performing, they don't become a composer or a performer.
  - Reading every book on surgery doesn't make one a surgeon; hands-on practice and innovation in surgical techniques are required.
  - Understanding the theory behind coding and algorithms doesn't make someone a software developer; practical application and problem-solving skills are necessary.
