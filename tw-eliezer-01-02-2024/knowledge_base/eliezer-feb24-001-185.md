claim: "Optimization for human desires can lead to outcomes vastly different from those anticipated by natural selection or ancestral norms."
premises:
  - claim: "Humans innovate new options like ice cream, which cater to desires not found in the ancestral environment."
  - claim: "This optimization process can result in outcomes that diverge from the natural correlations or functions."
  - claim: "Such divergence is shown when optimization for specific metrics, like test scores, leads to proficiency in those metrics while undermining the actual skill or quality, illustrated by the disparity between test scores and actual carpentry skills."
counterargument_to:
  - Humans naturally evolve to optimize their desires and needs in harmony with their environment, leading to beneficial outcomes.
  - Natural selection and ancestral norms inherently guide human development towards optimal survival and reproductive fitness.

strongest_objjection:
  - Humans are capable of adapting their environments and desires to align with natural selection and ancestral norms, thus preventing negative divergences.

consequences_if_true:
  - The divergence from natural selection and ancestral norms may lead to maladaptive behaviors or preferences that could harm individual or societal well-being.
  - There could be a widening gap between modern human desires and what is historically or evolutionarily beneficial, leading to health, social, or environmental issues.
  - Optimization based on current desires rather than long-term fitness could lead to unsustainable practices or technologies.

link_to_ai_safety: This argument underscores the importance of careful optimization in AI development to ensure that outcomes align with human well-being and ethical considerations, rather than merely optimizing for specific, possibly misaligned metrics.

simple_explanation: When humans innovate, like creating ice cream, they're catering to desires that weren't present in our ancestral environment, leading to outcomes that natural selection didn't anticipate. This process of optimizing for specific desires or metrics can sometimes result in a disconnect between what we're aiming for and what's actually beneficial. For example, if we focus too much on optimizing test scores, we might end up with people who are good at taking tests but not necessarily skilled at the subject, like carpentry. This shows how our pursuit of certain optimizations can diverge significantly from what would naturally occur or be expected based on historical norms.

examples:
  - The creation of highly processed foods that optimize for taste but may lead to health issues like obesity and diabetes, diverging from dietary norms that align with human health.
  - Education systems that focus on standard test scores, potentially neglecting critical thinking or practical skills, showing a divergence from educational practices that foster comprehensive understanding and capability.
  - Social media algorithms optimized to maximize user engagement time, possibly leading to addiction and mental health issues, a divergence from socializing norms that promote well-being.
