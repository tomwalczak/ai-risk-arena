claim: "If something is generally smarter than a human, it's probably also better at building AI systems."
premises:
  - claim: "Humans can design new AI systems."
  - claim: "Being generally smarter implies being better across various tasks, including AI development."
counterargument_to:
  - "General intelligence does not necessarily translate to the ability to perform specific tasks better, including AI development."
  - "AI development requires more than intelligence, such as creativity and specific knowledge domains that a generally smarter being might not possess."

strongest_objection:
  - "Being generally smarter does not automatically confer the ability to understand or innovate in highly specialized fields like AI development, which may require specific types of knowledge or thinking that general intelligence does not cover."

consequences_if_true:
  - "If generally smarter beings are indeed better at building AI systems, it would accelerate AI development, potentially leading to rapid advancements and breakthroughs."
  - "This could result in AI systems that surpass human intelligence much sooner than expected, raising ethical, safety, and control issues."
  - "It might lead to a concentration of power in entities (whether human or AI) capable of leveraging this intelligence to dominate AI development, raising concerns about inequality and governance."

link_to_ai_safety: This argument underscores the importance of AI safety by highlighting the potential for rapid advancements in AI development by entities smarter than humans, which could outpace our ability to ensure their safety and alignment with human values.

simple_explanation: If something is generally smarter than a human, it's probably also better at building AI systems because being smarter usually means you're better at a wide range of tasks, including complex ones like AI development. This is like how humans, who are smarter in a general sense compared to other animals, can invent and innovate in fields no other species can, such as technology and space exploration. If this is true for AI, then AI systems that are generally smarter than humans could potentially create even more advanced AI systems, leading us into uncharted territory much faster than we might be ready for.

examples:
  - "Humans, compared to chimpanzees, can innovate and solve problems across various domains, from architecture to space travel, showcasing how general intelligence translates to superior capabilities in diverse fields."
  - "GPT-4's performance in tasks it wasn't explicitly trained for suggests a spark of general intelligence, indicating that AI systems could eventually outperform humans in AI development."
  - "The rapid progression from GPT-3 to GPT-4, and the anticipation of GPT-5, exemplifies how quickly AI systems could evolve to surpass human intelligence in general capabilities, including AI development."
