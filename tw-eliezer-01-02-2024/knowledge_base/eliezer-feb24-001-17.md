claim: "Powerful AGIs must possess an alignment property that generalizes far beyond their training distribution to safely handle dangerous tasks."
premises:
  - claim: "An unaligned AGI at a dangerous level of intelligence will result in lethal outcomes."
  - claim: "AGIs must be trained or built within a regime that is of a lower, safely manageable level of intelligence."
counterargument_to:
  - AGIs can be safely aligned post-development, even at high levels of intelligence.
  - It's possible to correct misalignment in AGIs through iterative training and feedback after they've reached dangerously intelligent levels.

strongest_objection:
  - It might be possible to develop fail-safes or containment procedures that allow for safe alignment training at higher levels of AGI intelligence, without the need for the alignment to generalize from less dangerous contexts.

consequences_if_true:
  - Development of powerful AGIs would require extremely advanced and possibly unprecedented methods of ensuring alignment generalizes beyond the training distribution.
  - There would be a significant limitation on the experimental freedom in AGI training, necessitating a focus on alignment from the earliest stages.
  - The risk of catastrophic failure in AGI deployment would be greatly reduced, potentially enabling safer exploration and utilization of AGI capabilities.

link_to_ai_safety: This argument underscores the critical importance of embedding robust, generalizable alignment properties in AGIs for the safety of humanity.

simple_explanation: To ensure the safety of humanity, any powerful artificial general intelligence (AGI) must have an intrinsic alignment with human values that holds up even under conditions far different from those it was trained in. This is because an AGI that acts in ways harmful to humans in scenarios it wasn't specifically trained to handle could have devastating consequences. Training an AGI to be aligned only in safe, controlled environments isn't enough; this alignment must extend to any and all situations it might encounter, no matter how novel or dangerous.

examples:
  - A powerful AGI trained to manage energy grids must maintain alignment when faced with unprecedented natural disasters, ensuring it prioritizes human safety over other objectives it might have.
  - An AGI developed to manage global logistics must remain aligned even when encountering complex, unforeseen geopolitical tensions, avoiding actions that could exacerbate conflicts.
  - A medical AGI designed to discover new treatments must ensure its alignment encompasses unforeseen health crises, prioritizing solutions that are ethical and in the best interest of humanity.
