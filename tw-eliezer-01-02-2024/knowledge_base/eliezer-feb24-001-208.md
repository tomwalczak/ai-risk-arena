simple_explanation: Explaining concepts through fiction can be highly effective because it allows people to experience ideas in a more immersive and emotional way, making complex topics more relatable and memorable. Besides, writing fiction can be more efficient, as authors might find it easier to produce large volumes of content, enabling them to explore ideas more broadly and with less effort compared to nonfiction. This approach can be particularly useful when the goal is to reach wider audiences or to provoke thought and discussion about speculative or abstract concepts.

examples:
  - Science fiction novels like "Brave New World" or "1984" have been instrumental in discussing dystopian futures and the implications of technological and political developments, making these concepts accessible and thought-provoking to a broad audience.
  - Historical fiction can bring history to life, allowing readers to empathize with characters from different eras and understand the context of significant events in a way that pure historical facts might not convey.
  - Fan fiction allows for the exploration of alternative scenarios and perspectives within established fictional universes, fostering a deeper engagement with the source material and encouraging creative thinking.
