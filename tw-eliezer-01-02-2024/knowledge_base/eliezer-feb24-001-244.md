claim: "AI development has not progressed towards achieving general intelligence as expected."
premises:
  - claim: "The transition from GPT-3 to GPT-4 did not exhibit the clear emergence of general intelligence anticipated."
  - claim: "Expectations were set for significant discoveries leading to clear general intelligence, which have not been met."
counterargument_to:
  - AI development is rapidly approaching general intelligence.
  - The advancements from GPT-3 to GPT-4 are indicative of near-term achievement of general intelligence.

strongest_objection:
  - The improvements in AI capabilities from GPT-3 to GPT-4, while not signifying clear general intelligence, represent significant advancements in understanding and processing human language, which could be foundational steps towards achieving general intelligence.

consequences_if_true:
  - The pace of AI development towards general intelligence might be overestimated, requiring a recalibration of expectations and timelines.
  - Potential funding and interest in AI research could wane if expectations are continually not met, slowing progress even further.
  - The focus of AI research might shift towards refining existing technologies rather than making breakthroughs towards general intelligence.

link_to_ai_safety: Understanding the true pace of AI development towards general intelligence is crucial for timely and effective AI safety measures.

simple_explanation: Despite the impressive advancements in AI, such as the transition from GPT-3 to GPT-4, the anticipated leap towards general intelligence hasn't materialized. Expectations were high for significant breakthroughs that would clearly signal the emergence of general intelligence, but these have not been met. This mismatch between expectation and reality suggests that the journey towards creating an AI with human-like understanding and reasoning capabilities is more complex and challenging than previously thought.

examples:
  - The transition from GPT-3 to GPT-4 showed improvements in language understanding and generation, but did not exhibit self-awareness or the ability to reason across all domains, fundamental aspects of general intelligence.
  - Despite public debates on whether AI like GPT-4 could be considered sentient or deserving of rights, there's no consensus or scientific proof of AI possessing general intelligence or consciousness.
  - The anticipation of having to argue for AI rights in supreme courts as if they were sentient beings contrasts sharply with the current capabilities of AI, highlighting the gap between expectations and reality.
