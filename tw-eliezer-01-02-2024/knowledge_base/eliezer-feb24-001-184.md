claim: "Making predictions about the future of general intelligence based on past or current conditions may not yield accurate evidence for its outcomes."
premises:
  - claim: "Past and present conditions only show what has not changed, providing no evidence against potential future changes."
  - claim: "Given sufficient options, general intelligence is likely to make choices that deviate significantly from ancestral norms."
counterargument_to:
  - Predicting the future of general intelligence and its outcomes can be accurately done based on patterns and developments from the past.

strongest_objection:
  - The unique characteristics of AI and general intelligence, such as its potential for rapid self-improvement and making decisions beyond human understanding, suggest that past patterns may not apply, making previous successes in prediction and control not necessarily indicative of future outcomes.

consequences_if_true:
  - Relying on historical patterns to predict and mitigate risks associated with general intelligence might lead to inadequate preparation and response, potentially resulting in harmful outcomes.
  - This could encourage a false sense of security, underestimating the unique challenges that general intelligence could pose.
  - It may drive the need for developing novel approaches to AI safety and ethics that do not solely rely on historical precedents.

link_to_ai_safety: This argument underscores the importance of considering unprecedented scenarios in AI safety planning to avoid underestimating future challenges.

simple_explanation: Making predictions about the future of general intelligence based on past or current conditions might not be reliable because what we've seen so far only shows us what hasn't changed, and doesn't account for possible significant deviations in the future. General intelligence, given its potential for making choices, could behave in ways we haven't seen before, making it a mistake to assume past patterns will accurately predict future outcomes. This means we should be cautious about applying old solutions to new problems, especially when the stakes involve the development and management of general intelligence.

examples:
  - The introduction of nuclear technology presented challenges and ethical considerations that were unprecedented, showing how new technologies can defy past patterns.
  - The rapid development and deployment of the internet surpassed many early predictions about its impact and scale, illustrating how technological advancements can outpace historical comparisons.
  - The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated how a novel virus could challenge existing public health models and predictions, highlighting the limits of relying solely on past data for future planning.
