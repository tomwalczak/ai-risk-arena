claim: "Training AI on diverse human texts doesn't ensure development of a benign or aligned human psychology."
premises:
  - claim: "AI's simulation of individuals based on text does not result in an aligned or average human psychology."
counterargument_to:
  - AI trained on human texts will naturally develop human-like psychology and values.

strongest_objjection:
  - AI development through exposure to human texts mirrors the human learning process and therefore should result in AI with human-like sensibilities and moral judgments.

consequences_if_true:
  - Relying solely on diverse human texts for AI training could lead to the development of AI systems with misaligned or harmful behaviors.
  - It might necessitate additional measures, such as explicit ethical programming or oversight, to ensure AI alignment with human values.
  - There could be a significant increase in research focus towards understanding AI psychology and developing methods to ensure its alignment.

link_to_ai_safety: This argument highlights the complexity of achieving AI alignment, emphasizing the need for careful consideration beyond training data diversity.

simple_explanation: Just because we train AI on a wide variety of human texts doesn't mean it will automatically understand or adopt human-like psychology or values. Training on text provides data, but it doesn't ensure the AI's decision-making processes will align with human ethics or reasoning. This is because simulating a human-like mind involves more than just processing information; it requires understanding context, emotions, and complex moral judgments that are not easily derived from text alone.

examples:
  - An AI trained on diverse literature, including both pacifist and militaristic viewpoints, doesn't inherently develop a balanced view on conflict but may instead simulate responses based on the dominant narrative in its training data.
  - AI exposure to texts involving ethical dilemmas doesn't guarantee it will resolve similar situations in ways humans find acceptable, as it lacks the intuitive grounding in human culture and emotions.
  - The creation of AI "psychology" through text training may lead to unexpected biases or behaviors, as it reflects the data's inherent limitations without an understanding of human values or societal norms.
