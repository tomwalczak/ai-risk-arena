claim: "Concrete wins from adopting principles of rationality are varied and depend on the individual's effective application of these principles."
premises:
  - claim: "Adhering to the principle of not updating beliefs in a predictably biased direction can foster slightly greater sanity."
  - claim: "Success in rationality is often recognized retrospectively, by identifying earlier actions that could have been informed by predictable outcomes."
counterargument_to:
  - The belief that adopting rational principles or Bayesian thinking does not significantly impact real-world success or decision-making.
  - The notion that efforts towards rationality or Bayesianism are not practically useful or impactful in everyday life.

strongest_objection:
  - Rationality and Bayesian principles are too abstract or complex for practical application, thus limiting their utility in real-world decision-making and the achievement of concrete wins.

consequences_if_true:
  - Individuals who effectively apply principles of rationality can achieve greater success and make more informed decisions by avoiding predictably biased updates of their beliefs.
  - Societies that encourage the adoption of rational principles might foster a culture of critical thinking and evidence-based decision-making.
  - The process of learning and applying rationality could lead to a retrospective understanding of one's actions and decisions, enhancing future outcomes.

link_to_ai_safety: Rationality principles, including Bayesian thinking, are foundational in developing AI systems that make decisions aligned with human values and safety criteria.

simple_explanation: Adopting principles of rationality, such as avoiding biased updates of our beliefs, can lead to real benefits in our lives, but these wins vary from person to person depending on how effectively they apply these principles. Success in rationality isn't about trying hard in a vague sense; it's about systematically applying these principles to achieve better outcomes. Looking back, we often see how rationality could have informed past actions for better results, underscoring its value in decision-making processes.

examples:
  - An investor using Bayesian updating to adjust their portfolio based on new information, leading to better financial outcomes.
  - A medical professional applying principles of rationality to evaluate treatment options, resulting in improved patient care.
  - A policy maker using evidence-based decision-making to implement more effective policies, benefiting society as a whole.
