claim: "To slow AI progress, increasingly drastic measures would be required, impacting personal computing."
premises:
  - claim: "Improvements in AI algorithms will necessitate lower computational power ceilings."
  - claim: "Even without academic journals, encrypted communications will facilitate ongoing AI advancements."
counterargument_to:
  - "A temporary pause on AI research would benefit AI safety by allowing time for ethical and safety standards to catch up."
  - "Limiting computational power to slow AI progress is a practical and effective measure."

strongest_objjection:
  - "Slowing down AI progress might hinder the development of beneficial AI technologies that could address pressing global issues."

consequences_if_true:
  - "Implementing increasingly drastic measures to slow AI progress would significantly impact the functionality and accessibility of personal computing devices."
  - "AI development could become clandestine, with advancements happening in secret through encrypted communications, making it difficult to regulate or monitor."
  - "The gap between AI capabilities and AI safety measures could widen, as efforts to slow down AI progress inadvertently also slow down AI safety research."

link_to_ai_safety: This argument underscores the delicate balance between slowing AI progress to ensure safety and inadvertently halting essential safety research.

simple_explanation: To manage the rapid advancement of AI, we might think about putting brakes on its development, including limiting the power of computers. However, this approach could backfire. Not only would it likely impact everyday technology we rely on, but it might not even stop AI progress as researchers find ways around restrictions. More worryingly, it could halt important work on making AI safe, leaving us unprepared for future advancements.

examples:
  - "Limiting GPU power for consumers could make it harder for everyday users to play video games or use graphic-intensive applications, illustrating the impact on personal computing."
  - "Researchers might use VPNs and encrypted messaging apps to share breakthroughs and collaborate internationally, circumventing restrictions."
  - "During the COVID-19 pandemic, limitations on laboratory access slowed some types of research but not the sharing of research findings and collaboration, showing how progress can continue despite restrictions."
