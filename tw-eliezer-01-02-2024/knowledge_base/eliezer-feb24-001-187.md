claim: "To understand the potential actions of general intelligence, we should examine the mechanics of change rather than rely on present conditions."
premises:
  - claim: "As humans have gained more options, their choices have expanded beyond the ancestral norm."
  - claim: "The divergence from ancestral norms is driven by human desires evolving with culture, faster than natural selection."
  - claim: "Inventing and optimizing for new desires (e.g., ice cream) demonstrates how specific optimizations can lead to outcomes unanticipated by natural selection."
counterargument_to:
  - The best way to anticipate the actions of general intelligence is to focus on current conditions and trends.
  - Understanding general intelligence requires focusing on the broad scale of human history and evolution without delving into the specifics of cultural and technological changes.

strongest_objjection:
  - Humans and general intelligence may not be directly comparable, as AI could have fundamentally different optimization processes and desires that do not evolve in response to culture or natural selection.

consequences_if_true:
  - Relying solely on present conditions to predict the actions of general intelligence might lead to significant oversight of potential outcomes.
  - A deeper understanding of the mechanics of change could reveal unexpected avenues through which general intelligence might develop.
  - This approach might necessitate a reassessment of how we prepare for and mitigate the potential risks associated with the development of general intelligence.

link_to_ai_safety: This argument underscores the importance of understanding the underlying mechanisms that drive change to ensure the safe development of general intelligence.

simple_explanation: To grasp how general intelligence might act in the future, it's crucial to look beyond current situations and examine how changes occur over time. Just as human desires and capabilities have evolved beyond our ancestors' through cultural advancements and technological innovations, general intelligence will likely follow a path not entirely predictable by today's standards. Understanding this evolution, rather than assuming stability or linear progression based on the present, is key to anticipating the full range of actions general intelligence could undertake.

examples:
  - The invention of ice cream as an optimization of human desires for sweetness, which was not anticipated by natural selection, illustrates how specific optimizations can lead to unexpected outcomes.
  - The Goodhart's law scenario, where optimizing for a specific test score leads to a decrease in actual carpentry skills, demonstrates the divergence between optimization goals and practical outcomes.
  - The rapid evolution of culture and technology in human societies, outpacing natural selection, suggests a potential for similarly rapid and unpredictable developments in general intelligence.
