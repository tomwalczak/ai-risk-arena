link_to_ai_safety: Education, knowledge, and enlightenment being instruments for moral betterment suggests that designing AI systems with the capacity to learn and adapt morally as they gain intelligence is crucial for AI safety.

simple_explanation: Imagine a world where every time someone learned something new, they not only got better at achieving their goals but also started aiming for goals that are better for everyone around them. This is what happens when education doesn't just fill our heads with facts but also teaches us to think about what's right and wrong, and how we can make the world a better place. In essence, the more we know, the nicer we become, making education and knowledge key tools in improving not just our lives, but the moral fabric of our society as a whole.

examples:
  - "Historically, periods of enlightenment and increased access to education have been followed by reforms in human rights and more ethical governance practices."
  - "Educational programs that focus on empathy and ethical decision-making have been shown to reduce bullying in schools."
  - "Countries with higher literacy rates often have lower rates of violent crime, indicating a link between education and moral behavior."
