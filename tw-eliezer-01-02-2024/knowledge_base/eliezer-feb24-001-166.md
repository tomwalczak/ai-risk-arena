claim: "The skepticism against rapid and transformative technological advancements can also question accepted visions of technological and cosmological progress."
premises:
  - claim: "Many people accept a shift towards a world inhabited by intelligently designed beings."
  - claim: "This acceptance contrasts with their skepticism towards significant transformations like the rapture."
counterargument_to:
  - The notion that skepticism towards transformative technologies is unfounded or overly cautious.
  - The idea that skepticism towards the rapture (or similar significant transformations) is fundamentally different from skepticism towards the acceptance of a world dominated by intelligently designed beings.

strongest_objection:
  - Skepticism towards rapid and transformative advancements is based on realistic assessments of current technological limitations and ethical considerations, not a lack of vision for technological and cosmological progress.

consequences_if_true:
  - It would highlight a cognitive dissonance in how people view the potential for technological and cosmological shifts, supporting both the incredible and the mundane with different standards of evidence or belief.
  - This realization could lead to a more nuanced discourse around technological advancements, acknowledging both the potential and the limitations without default skepticism.
  - It might encourage a reevaluation of what advancements are deemed "acceptable" or "believable," potentially opening up new avenues for innovation and exploration that were previously dismissed.

link_to_ai_safety: This argument underscores the importance of scrutinizing our biases and assumptions in the discourse on AI safety, ensuring that skepticism is applied consistently and constructively.

simple_explanation: People generally accept the idea of moving towards a world filled with intelligently designed beings, yet they often dismiss significant transformations like the rapture due to skepticism. This skepticism, while seeming selective, actually challenges the consistency of our beliefs about technological and cosmological progress. Essentially, if we can believe in such a vast shift towards a world of design over replication, why do we balk at other transformative ideas? Recognizing this inconsistency in our skepticism could lead to more open-minded discussions about future advancements and the direction of our technological evolution.

examples:
  - The acceptance of artificial intelligence and its potential to redesign aspects of our world, contrasted with skepticism about AI reaching singularity.
  - Belief in the feasibility of colonizing other planets while doubting more radical ideas like terraforming.
  - Embracing genetic engineering and synthetic biology as a future norm but hesitating to consider the implications of creating entirely new forms of life.
