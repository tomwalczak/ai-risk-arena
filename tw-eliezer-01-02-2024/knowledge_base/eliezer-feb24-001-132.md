claim: "People inherently act on the assumption that the world will not end imminently by continuing their investments and plans."
premises:
  - claim: "Individuals annually optimize their decisions based on the expectation that the world will persist, affecting their financial and strategic choices."
  - claim: "This collective behavior demonstrates a widespread belief in the continuity of human civilization despite potential existential threats."
counterargument_to:
  - The idea that people are actively preparing for potential global catastrophes in an effective and coordinated manner.
  - The belief that humanity, as a whole, is taking existential threats seriously and acting accordingly.

strongest_objection:
  - Some may argue that the apparent lack of immediate action or concern towards existential threats is not due to disbelief in the continuity of human civilization, but rather a result of psychological distance, where individuals feel these threats are too far in the future to warrant present action, or a sense of helplessness in the face of such overwhelming challenges.

consequences_if_true:
  - If true, this implies a fundamental optimism or denial embedded in human decision-making processes, potentially leading to underpreparedness for existential threats.
  - It suggests that societal and individual actions are guided by an implicit belief in the future's stability, which might hinder the prioritization of immediate, large-scale efforts to mitigate existential risks.
  - This behavior could lead to a dangerous complacency, making civilization more vulnerable to unforeseen catastrophic events.

link_to_ai_safety: This argument highlights the importance of integrating existential risk, including AI safety, into mainstream decision-making and planning processes.

simple_explanation: Most people, whether they realize it or not, act on the belief that the world will keep on spinning. They make financial investments, plan for their futures, and make strategic decisions all based on the assumption that civilization will continue. This widespread behavior shows a collective optimism or perhaps denial about the existence of existential threats, such as catastrophic climate change or uncontrolled AI, which could abruptly end human civilization as we know it. The problem is, if we're all planning for a future without taking these potential world-ending threats seriously, we might be setting ourselves up for a disaster we could have prevented.

examples:
  - Individuals saving for retirement or investing in long-term financial products assume a stable economic and societal future.
  - Governments and corporations making long-term infrastructural investments without incorporating existential risk assessments.
  - The rapid development and deployment of AI technologies without sufficient consideration of long-term alignment and safety issues.
