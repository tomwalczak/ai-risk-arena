claim: "Humans aggregating don't actually get much smarter compared to running them for longer."
premises:
  - claim: "In the game of Kasparov versus the world, Garry Kasparov won against an internet horde led by four chess grandmasters."
  - claim: "The difference in capabilities between now and a thousand years ago is greater than between ten people and one person."
counterargument_to:
  - "The more individuals collaborating on a problem, the smarter and more effective the solution."
  - "Group intelligence significantly surpasses individual intelligence in complex problem-solving."

strongest_objection:
  - "The internet horde led by grandmasters in Kasparov versus the world might not have had optimal coordination or strategy, limiting their collective intelligence."
  - "Technological and societal advancements over thousands of years are cumulative and driven by countless individuals, not a fair comparison to immediate group problem-solving."

consequences_if_true:
  - "It would suggest a limit to the effectiveness of crowd-sourcing in solving complex problems."
  - "It might imply that for certain tasks, individual expertise and prolonged effort are more valuable than collective input."
  - "It could influence how we design systems for aggregating human decision-making, perhaps valuing depth of experience over sheer numbers."

link_to_ai_safety: This argument suggests that enhancing individual cognitive capabilities or operational speed could be more effective for problem-solving than aggregating multiple intelligences, which has implications for designing safer AI systems by focusing on quality over quantity of processing.

simple_explanation: Despite what we might assume, getting a bunch of people together doesn't make us significantly smarter as a group, as shown when chess champion Garry Kasparov beat a whole team of internet users and grandmasters. It turns out that the progress humanity has made over a thousand years isn't just because we've got more people thinking about problems; it's also about how much longer and deeper each person can think about them. This suggests that for really tough problems, maybe we're better off focusing on making a few minds really good rather than trying to get everyone's input.

examples:
  - "In the game Kasparov versus the world, despite the collective effort of internet users and grandmasters, Kasparov emerged victorious."
  - "Technological advancements, such as the creation of the internet, are often attributed to individual geniuses or small teams working intensively rather than large, uncoordinated crowds."
  - "Crowd-sourcing platforms like Wikipedia succeed not merely through the quantity of contributors but through the quality of contributions and the system's ability to refine and integrate these inputs effectively."
