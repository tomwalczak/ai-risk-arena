claim: "Humans have historically made choices that diverge from ancestral norms when presented with more options."
premises:
  - claim: "50,000 years ago, human desires and available options were aligned with reproductive fitness."
  - claim: "With increased intelligence, humans have developed culture, creating options beyond those in the ancestral environment."
  - claim: "These newly created options often aim to fulfill human desires not aligned with ancestral norms or reproductive fitness."
counterargument_to:
  - Humans naturally evolve to optimize their behavior for reproductive fitness, and any deviation from this path is either temporary or detrimental.
  - Cultural advancements are merely extensions of human evolution that continue to enhance our reproductive success.

strongest_objjection:
  - The argument underestimates the complexity of human desires and oversimplifies the impact of culture on evolutionary fitness. Humans still seek qualities in mates and make life choices that can be linked back to evolutionary advantages, suggesting that not all cultural developments diverge from enhancing reproductive fitness.

consequences_if_true:
  - If humans consistently choose options that diverge from ancestral norms, this might lead to a societal shift where traditional evolutionary pressures are no longer the primary drivers of human behavior.
  - This divergence could result in the development of a society where cultural evolution significantly outpaces biological evolution, creating a disconnect between our biological inclinations and cultural practices.
  - Such a shift could potentially lead to unforeseen consequences on human health, social structures, and overall well-being, as our biological evolution might not keep pace with our cultural innovations.

link_to_ai_safety: This argument highlights the importance of aligning AI's objectives with human values, as our cultural evolution creates desires and goals that might not align with our ancestral, evolutionary programming.

simple_explanation: Over the last 50,000 years, humans have evolved to prioritize desires that were once closely aligned with reproductive success. However, as our intelligence and ability to create culture have grown, we've developed a myriad of new options that fulfill desires beyond those evolutionary goals. While this shows our capacity for innovation, it also means we're choosing paths that diverge significantly from those of our ancestors, prioritizing personal fulfillment over evolutionary fitness. This creates a complex landscape we must navigate, especially as we design future technologies and AI systems that align with these evolved desires.

examples:
  - The invention of contraceptives allows individuals to engage in sexual relationships without the consequence of childbirth, prioritizing personal or mutual pleasure over reproduction.
  - The development of processed foods like ice cream, which prioritize taste and immediate gratification over nutritional value, which would have been key to survival and fitness in ancestral environments.
  - The rising trend in choosing careers and personal development over starting a family at a young age, which reflects a shift in priorities that may not directly contribute to reproductive success.
