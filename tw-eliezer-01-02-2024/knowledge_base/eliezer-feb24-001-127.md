claim: "The challenge of enhancing human cognition is illustrated by the Center for Applied Rationality's limited success."
premises:
  - claim: "Despite efforts to improve decision-making and alignment understanding, progress has been minimal."
  - claim: "This underscores the difficulty of fundamentally advancing human rationality."
counterargument_to:
  - The premise that human rationality and decision-making can be significantly improved through structured training and interventions.
  - The belief that cognitive enhancement is a straightforward task that can be systematically approached with current methodologies.

strongest_objection:
  - Cognitive enhancement and rationality training may have had more subtle, long-term impacts that are not immediately measurable or visible, suggesting that the Center for Applied Rationality's efforts cannot be deemed unsuccessful yet.

consequences_if_true:
  - It may indicate a ceiling effect for cognitive interventions, suggesting there are inherent limits to how much rational decision-making can be improved.
  - This could lead to a reevaluation of the methods and theories used in cognitive enhancement, pushing for innovative approaches or a shift in focus.
  - Efforts and resources might be reallocated to other areas of human enhancement or well-being that offer more tangible benefits.

link_to_ai_safety: This argument highlights the complexity of aligning goals and understanding environments, a challenge paralleled in the field of AI safety.

simple_explanation: Enhancing human cognition and rationality proves to be a daunting task, as evidenced by the Center for Applied Rationality's limited success in significantly improving decision-making skills. This difficulty suggests that there might be fundamental limits to how much we can advance human rationality, despite extensive efforts. The challenge lies not in the lack of trying but in the inherent complexity and potential ceiling effects of cognitive enhancement.

examples:
  - The mixed results seen in educational interventions aimed at improving critical thinking and problem-solving skills.
  - The limited effectiveness of corporate training programs designed to enhance employee decision-making and innovation.
  - The challenge in creating lasting behavioral change in health and fitness domains despite knowing rational benefits.
