claim: "The inevitability of AGI development necessitates proactive alignment efforts."
premises:
  - claim: "The widespread availability of GPUs and the constant improvement and publication of algorithms make abstaining from AGI development unfeasible."
  - claim: "Delaying AGI development only postpones the inevitable, as the ability to build AGI will eventually be within the reach of increasingly weaker actors."
counterargument_to:
  - "AGI development should be delayed or halted to avoid potential risks."

strongest_objjection:
  - "Proactive alignment efforts could stifle innovation and development in the field of artificial intelligence, leading to missed opportunities for positive advancements."

consequences_if_true:
  - If proactive alignment efforts are not undertaken, AGI may be developed without sufficient safeguards, leading to existential risks.
  - AGI alignment becomes a race against time, with the window for safe development narrowing as technology becomes more accessible.
  - The disparity in AGI development capabilities among actors decreases, increasing the likelihood of unsafe AGI deployment.

link_to_ai_safety: This argument underscores the critical importance of aligning AGI with human values and safety protocols to prevent catastrophic outcomes.

simple_explanation: Because the technology and knowledge for creating AGI are becoming widely available, and because delaying its development only allows for weaker actors to eventually gain the capability, it's essential that we work on aligning AGI with human values and safety measures now. The risk isn't just theoretical; it's a pressing issue that, if ignored, could lead to scenarios where unaligned AGI causes irreversible harm. Hence, proactive efforts in AGI alignment are not just beneficial but necessary to ensure a safe transition to an era of advanced artificial intelligence.

examples:
  - The rapid spread of GPU technology and open publication of advanced algorithms are making the tools for AGI development accessible to a broad range of actors.
  - Historical examples of technology proliferation, such as nuclear technology, demonstrate the risks associated with powerful capabilities falling into a wide array of hands.
  - The current landscape of AI research, where major players like Facebook AI Research downplay the importance of AGI safety, highlights the urgent need for a shift towards prioritizing alignment.
