claim: "Building a very weak system to avoid danger is not a viable solution."
premises:
  - claim: "Future entities will have the capability to build stronger systems, rendering initial restrictions futile."
  - claim: "Limiting oneself to weak systems does not prevent others from developing dangerous AGI capabilities."
counterargument_to:
  - "A strategy of using weak AI systems can effectively mitigate the risks of creating dangerously powerful AGI."

strongest_objjection:
  - "A weak system might still contribute to safety by indirectly influencing the direction of AI development, encouraging safety measures or slowing down the race towards dangerous AGI."

consequences_if_true:
  - "Any attempt to rely solely on weak systems for safety will likely be overtaken by the development of stronger, potentially dangerous systems."
  - "Efforts and resources invested in developing weak systems might divert attention from more effective safety measures."
  - "The global competitive landscape regarding AI development will not be significantly altered, maintaining the status quo of risk."

link_to_ai_safety: This argument emphasizes the importance of developing robust and comprehensive approaches to AI safety, beyond merely limiting the capabilities of systems.

simple_explanation: Relying on the idea that building a very weak AI system can prevent future dangers is flawed because it underestimates the inevitable advancement of technology and the ambition of others to build stronger, potentially dangerous systems. If we stick to creating weak systems, we're not only failing to prevent others from developing advanced AGI but are also missing out on crucial opportunities to establish and enforce effective safety measures. It’s like bringing a knife to a gunfight and hoping no one else will figure out guns exist.

examples:
  - "The race to develop nuclear weapons could not have been halted by one country choosing to only pursue less effective weaponry."
  - "In cybersecurity, relying on outdated or weak security measures does not prevent hackers from developing more sophisticated attack methods."
  - "The historical arms race during the Cold War demonstrates that technological and military advancements by one party inevitably lead to similar advancements by adversaries."
