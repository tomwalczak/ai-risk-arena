claim: "The technical possibility of safe AI development does not ensure the world will adapt to prevent harm."
premises:
  - claim: "A technical solution exists if the correct actions are taken."
  - claim: "The world's current actions and trajectory do not align with the necessary steps for safe AI development."
counterargument_to:
  - "AI safety research is effectively addressing the core challenges of preventing AI-induced harm."
  - "The field of AI safety is making significant progress towards ensuring AI technologies are developed and deployed safely."

strongest_objection:
  - "Significant advancements in AI safety could be occurring but are not visible or recognized due to the field's current structure and incentives."

consequences_if_true:
  - "There may be a false sense of security regarding the safety of AI development, leading to complacency."
  - "Resources meant for solving AI safety issues could be misallocated to less critical or ineffective projects."
  - "The gap between technical possibility and actual safety measures implementation widens, increasing the risk of harm from advanced AI systems."

link_to_ai_safety: This argument highlights the disparity between the technical feasibility of safe AI development and the practical actions (or lack thereof) being taken, thus underscoring a significant risk in the field of AI safety.

simple_explanation: Even though we might have the technical know-how to develop AI safely, the reality is that the world isn't taking the steps necessary to implement these solutions. This is because the field of AI safety is currently more focused on tackling problems that allow researchers to show success and secure funding, rather than addressing the genuinely hard challenges that could actually prevent harm from AI. As a result, pouring resources into the field without changing its direction is likely to yield little real progress towards ensuring AI safety.

examples:
  - The focus on publishable success over unglamorous but crucial safety measures, leading to a misalignment of efforts and outcomes.
  - The potential misallocation of a hypothetical billion-dollar investment in AI safety, which might end up supporting projects that do not effectively mitigate AI risks.
  - Historical precedents in other technological fields where the technical capability for safety existed but was not implemented due to lack of alignment between research incentives and actual safety needs.
