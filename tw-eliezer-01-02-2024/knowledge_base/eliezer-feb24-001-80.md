claim: "Human preferences regarding reproduction and genetic modification are less predictable than the passage of time."
premises:
  - claim: "While there is a current preference for natural reproduction and using available technology for health, future preferences for genetic modification are uncertain."
  - claim: "Assuming preferences for future genetic technologies based on current behaviors is unfounded."
counterargument_to:
  - The belief that human preferences regarding reproduction and genetic modification will remain consistent over time, closely following current attitudes and behaviors.
  - The assumption that current technological trends and societal norms around reproduction and genetic enhancement can accurately predict future preferences and decisions.

strongest_objection:
  - Human behavior and preferences have historically shown a capacity to adapt and change significantly in response to technological advancements, societal shifts, and new ethical considerations, suggesting that future preferences for genetic modification could indeed become more predictable as the technology becomes more understood and integrated into society.

consequences_if_true:
  - A shift in societal norms and values towards more acceptance of genetic modification, potentially leading to widespread use of such technologies for non-health related enhancements.
  - An increase in ethical and philosophical debates surrounding the nature of humanity, consent, and the boundaries of genetic modification.
  - Potential regulatory and policy challenges as governments and international bodies attempt to navigate the uncharted waters of human genetic modification.

link_to_ai_safety: This argument highlights the unpredictability of human preferences in the context of technological advancements, a factor crucial to consider in AI safety discussions, especially regarding how societies will adapt to and regulate emerging technologies.

simple_explanation: Human preferences, especially concerning reproduction and genetic modification, are incredibly dynamic and influenced by a myriad of factors, making them unpredictable over time. While today there's a general preference for natural reproduction and cautious use of technology for health purposes, we cannot reliably predict how future generations will feel about more radical genetic modifications. This unpredictability challenges us to remain open-minded and adaptable in our planning for future technologies, including the ethical considerations and societal impacts they may bring.

examples:
  - The historical shift from skepticism to acceptance of in-vitro fertilization (IVF) and other assisted reproductive technologies.
  - The changing attitudes towards plastic surgery, once stigmatized and now increasingly normalized.
  - The evolution of societal norms around technology use, from the initial fear and skepticism towards personal computers and the internet to their now ubiquitous and integral role in daily life.
