claim: "Breeding humans for intelligence and cooperation is complex and risky"
premises:
  - claim: "Selective breeding in humans can lead to unexpected correlations and outcomes, similar to animal breeding"
  - claim: "Enhancing traits beyond current human levels could result in unforeseen psychological issues"
counterargument_to:
  - The claim that breeding humans for specific traits like intelligence and cooperation is straightforward and can yield predictable, positive results.

strongest_objjection:
  - Genetic diversity and unexpected mutations might lead to positive outcomes or enhancements in resilience that are not considered when selectively breeding for specific traits.

consequences_if_true:
  - Selective breeding for specific traits in humans could lead to a decrease in genetic diversity, increasing vulnerability to diseases or environmental changes.
  - Unintended psychological issues arising from enhanced traits could result in societal disruptions or ethical dilemmas regarding the treatment of individuals with these artificially selected traits.
  - The process and outcomes of such selective breeding could exacerbate social inequalities, creating classes of individuals based on genetically engineered traits.

link_to_ai_safety: This argument underscores the complexity and unpredictability of manipulating intelligence, relevant to debates on AI design and safety, where enhancing AI capabilities could also lead to unforeseen risks.

simple_explanation: Breeding humans for intelligence and cooperation is fraught with risks because, like in animal breeding, it can lead to unexpected and potentially harmful correlations between traits. When we attempt to push traits beyond their natural human variation, we're navigating uncharted psychological territory, which could provoke unforeseen psychological issues. Just as breeding animals for specific traits sometimes results in unintended side effects, applying similar methods to humans could have complex and unpredictable consequences, making it a risky endeavor.

examples:
  - Selectively breeding dogs for physical traits like flat faces has led to widespread health problems among breeds like pugs and bulldogs, showing how focusing on one trait can negatively impact others.
  - The Russian Silver Fox experiment, where foxes were bred for tameness, resulted in a range of unexpected physical changes, illustrating the unpredictable nature of selective breeding.
  - Historical attempts at eugenics in humans, aiming to enhance desirable traits, not only failed but also led to gross violations of human rights, highlighting the ethical and practical dangers of trying to engineer human traits.
