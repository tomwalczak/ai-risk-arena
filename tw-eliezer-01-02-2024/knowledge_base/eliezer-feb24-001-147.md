claim: "Yudkowsky finds some comfort in the concept of many worlds or a spatially infinite universe, where versions of humanity survive."
premises:
  - claim: "Yudkowsky considers the possibility that in a vast or quantum multiverse, there are versions of Earth that fare better than ours."
  - claim: "The idea of worlds where humanity survives or thrives offers him a form of comfort."
counterargument_to:
  - The belief that our universe, and specifically humanity's fate within it, is singular and finite, leaving no room for alternative outcomes or versions of humanity.

strongest_objjection:
  - The concept of many worlds or a spatially infinite universe is purely theoretical and lacks empirical evidence, making it a speculative source of comfort rather than a scientifically grounded one.

consequences_if_true:
  - If true, this suggests that no matter the outcome on our version of Earth, some versions of humanity survive or even thrive, offering a form of existential consolation.
  - It implies a broader understanding of existence, where humanity's survival is not limited to the fate of our particular Earth.
  - It could shift the focus from preventing global catastrophic risks to ensuring that at least in some versions of the universe, humanity continues.

link_to_ai_safety: This argument highlights the importance of considering multiple outcomes and scenarios, a principle that is crucial in the field of AI safety to prevent existential risks.

simple_explanation: Eliezer Yudkowsky finds solace in the idea that, in a vast or quantum multiverse, there are versions of Earth that do better than ours. This thought offers him comfort by suggesting that even if our world faces insurmountable challenges, somewhere in the infinite expanses of the universe, versions of humanity manage to survive or even create utopian societies. It's a perspective that, while speculative, proposes an infinite game where humanity's story doesn't necessarily end with our planet's potential failures.

examples:
  - In a spatially infinite universe, somewhere, there's an Earth that avoided major historical catastrophes, leading to a more advanced and peaceful civilization.
  - In the quantum multiverse, there could be a version of Earth where humanity has successfully navigated the dangers of advanced AI, living in harmony with technology.
  - Among the infinite possibilities, there might exist civilizations that have mastered interstellar travel, expanding humanity's reach and ensuring its long-term survival.
