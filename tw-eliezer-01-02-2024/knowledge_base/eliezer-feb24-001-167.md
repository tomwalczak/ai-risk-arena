claim: "AI alignment could potentially be simpler or easier than anticipated."
premises:
  - claim: "Significant resources or brainpower have not yet been dedicated to solving AI alignment."
  - claim: "Comparable efforts to those in other complex fields could simplify AI alignment challenges."
  - claim: "AI systems pre-trained on human thought may simplify alignment."
counterargument_to:
  - "AI alignment is an inherently complex and unsolvable problem at our current level of understanding and technology."
  - "The difficulty of AI alignment is so significant that attempting to solve it is futile or not worth the investment."

strongest_objjection:
  - "The complexity of AI and human values makes alignment fundamentally difficult, regardless of the resources allocated or the pre-training on human thought, and may not be simplified by comparable efforts in other fields."

consequences_if_true:
  - "More organizations and governments might allocate significant resources towards AI alignment research, believing in its feasibility."
  - "A surge in interdisciplinary collaboration could occur, pooling expertise from diverse fields to tackle AI alignment."
  - "Pre-training AI systems on human thought could become a standard approach in AI development, influencing the direction of AI research."

link_to_ai_safety: This argument underlines a potentially optimistic pathway towards ensuring AI systems can safely and reliably understand and act in accordance with human values and intentions.

simple_explanation: If we consider that significant resources and brainpower have not yet been fully dedicated to solving AI alignment, and draw parallels from other complex fields where concerted efforts have led to breakthroughs, it suggests that AI alignment might be more tractable than we currently believe. Furthermore, leveraging AI systems pre-trained on human thought could inherently make them more aligned with our values and easier to work with. Therefore, investing in AI alignment research could be a viable and crucial step towards safe AI development.

examples:
  - "The Human Genome Project was once considered an insurmountable challenge, but focused efforts and collaboration simplified the complexity, leading to its successful completion ahead of schedule."
  - "Deep learning was a niche area within AI research with limited progress until significant investments in computational power and datasets in the 2010s accelerated its development."
  - "Pre-training language models on vast amounts of text data has significantly improved their understanding of human language, suggesting a parallel in pre-training AI on human thought for alignment."
