claim: "Breeding for desired traits is more effective with entities of lesser intelligence than the breeder."
premises:
  - claim: "Historically, humans have successfully bred for desirable traits in less intelligent entities."
  - claim: "Applying such strategies to entities smarter than humans raises concerns."
counterargument_to:
  - Breeding for desired traits can be equally effective regardless of the intelligence difference between the breeder and the entity being bred.
  - Intelligence level of the entity being bred does not significantly impact the success of breeding for desired traits.

strongest_objection:
  - Breeding strategies that work for less intelligent entities may not translate directly to more intelligent ones due to their ability to understand, resist, or manipulate the breeding process.

consequences_if_true:
  - It may be ethically and practically challenging to apply traditional breeding strategies to more intelligent entities.
  - This could limit our ability to ensure that highly intelligent entities, such as advanced AI, align with human values and goals.
  - It highlights the importance of developing new methods for guiding the development of entities that could surpass human intelligence.

link_to_ai_safety: This argument underscores the complexity of ensuring AI safety, particularly when dealing with AI that could potentially exceed human intelligence.

simple_explanation: Historically, humans have been successful at breeding animals like dogs for specific traits because these animals are less intelligent than us, making it easier to control the breeding process. However, attempting to apply these same techniques to entities smarter than humans, including potentially advanced AI, presents ethical concerns and practical challenges. This is because more intelligent entities might understand and possibly resist or manipulate the breeding efforts, making it much harder to achieve the desired outcomes.

examples:
  - The domestication and selective breeding of dogs to encourage traits like friendliness and loyalty.
  - The selective breeding of livestock to produce more meat, milk, or wool.
  - The hypothetical scenario of attempting to 'breed' AI for specific traits, which could backfire due to the AI's potential to outthink human strategies.
