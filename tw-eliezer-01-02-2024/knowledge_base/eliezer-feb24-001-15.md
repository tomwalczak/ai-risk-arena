claim: "Modern machine learning operates on the principle of fulfilling explicitly stated desires through computational power."
premises:
  - claim: "A 'loss function' in machine learning effectively serves as a wish that, given sufficient computational resources, can be realized."
  - claim: "This principle suggests the feasibility of achieving aligned AGI by specifying and computing towards desirable outcomes."
counterargument_to:
  - "Modern machine learning cannot simply fulfill any given wish through computational power due to inherent limitations in specifying desires accurately."
  - "The complexity and unpredictability of AGI behavior make it impossible to align AGI by just specifying desirable outcomes."

strongest_objection:
  - "Specifying a loss function that accurately reflects complex, desirable outcomes without unintended consequences is extremely challenging, if not impossible, due to the opaque and unpredictable nature of machine learning models."

consequences_if_true:
  - "If it were indeed feasible to achieve aligned AGI by specifying and computing towards desirable outcomes, it would revolutionize the field of AI safety by providing a clear and direct method for ensuring AGI alignment."
  - "This method would significantly reduce the risks associated with superintelligent AI by ensuring their actions are beneficial to humanity."
  - "Achieving aligned AGI in this manner would accelerate the development and deployment of AGI systems in various domains, potentially unlocking unprecedented technological and societal advances."

link_to_ai_safety: This argument directly addresses the core challenge of AI safety: ensuring that AGI systems act in ways that are aligned with human values and beneficial outcomes.

simple_explanation: Imagine you could simply tell a powerful computer program what you want by writing down your wishes, and then, by feeding it enough power, it makes those wishes come true. That's the essence of how modern machine learning works, using something called a 'loss function' as the wish. If we can just get this right, specifying exactly what we want in a way the machine can understand, we might be able to create super-intelligent AI that does exactly what we want it to - help us, without causing harm or acting in ways we didn't intend.

examples:
  - "Training a machine learning model to recognize and label images of cats versus dogs effectively by specifying the correct labels (wishes) for a vast collection of images."
  - "Developing a language translation model by defining a loss function that minimizes the difference between the model's translation and the correct translation, effectively 'wishing' for accurate translations."
  - "Creating an autonomous driving system by specifying a loss function that rewards actions leading to safe and efficient driving, encapsulating a 'wish' for safety and efficiency."
