claim: "Rationality is often misconceived as being incompatible with success."
premises:
  - claim: "Rationality should be seen as systematized winning, contrasting with flawed philosophical notions where rationality leads to predictable failures."
  - claim: "The misconception is highlighted in classical causal decision theory, where rational players are depicted as losing in situations like ultimatum games, contrary to a more accurate understanding of rationality where rational choices lead to winning."
counterargument_to:
  - Rationality leads to unfavorable outcomes in practical scenarios, especially in social and economic games.
  - Rational actors are at a disadvantage in interactions with irrational or less predictable agents.

strongest_objection:
  - Rational decisions might not always lead to immediate winning or success, especially in scenarios where other actors behave irrationally or when the game's rules reward non-rational behavior.

consequences_if_true:
  - Redefining rationality as systematized winning could lead to a paradigm shift in decision theory, emphasizing outcomes over traditional rational processes.
  - It could encourage a more pragmatic approach to rationality, where the focus shifts from idealized, theoretical rational behavior to practical, outcome-oriented strategies.
  - This redefinition might lead to the development of new decision-making frameworks that better account for human behavior and irrationality in strategic interactions.

link_to_ai_safety: This argument emphasizes the importance of outcome-oriented rationality in AI, suggesting that aligning AI's decision-making processes with systematized winning could enhance AI safety by ensuring AI actions lead to beneficial outcomes.

simple_explanation: Rationality is often misunderstood as a trait that leads to losing, especially in strategic games or social interactions, where being rational is seen as a disadvantage. However, this view is flawed because true rationality should be about winning or achieving goals effectively, not just following a set of logical rules that don't account for real-world complexities. By redefining rationality as the ability to systematically win, we can develop better strategies that take into account the unpredictable nature of real-life scenarios and other players' behaviors. This isn't just about theoretical wins in games but about making decisions that lead to real, tangible success in everyday life and complex systems.

examples:
  - In the ultimatum game, traditional rationality suggests accepting any non-zero offer, yet real-world behavior often deviates from this, with players rejecting low offers to punish unfairness. A systematized winning approach would anticipate and incorporate such human behaviors.
  - The Star Trek episode mentioned, where Kirk's seemingly irrational move wins the game, illustrates that success often requires thinking outside traditional notions of rationality.
  - Current academic decision theories, such as classical causal decision theory, often fail to predict or explain successful outcomes in real-world scenarios, highlighting the need for a reevaluation of what rationality means in practice.
