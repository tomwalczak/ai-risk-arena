claim: "Making predictions about AI's impact with precise probabilities is not useful."
premises:
  - claim: "Assigning specific probabilities to future events regarding AI's impact can make one's reasoning less effective, as it's not aligned with the optimal functioning of the human brain."
  - claim: "Predicting specific outcomes with precise probabilities doesn't significantly influence one's actions since individuals are likely to proceed with their plans regardless of the probabilities assigned."
counterargument_to:
  - Assigning precise probabilities to AI's future impact is crucial for effective decision-making.
  - Precise probabilities help in understanding and preparing for AI's future impact with greater clarity.

strongest_objection:
  - Probabilistic forecasts in complex systems can sometimes outperform non-quantitative judgments, providing a more structured approach to uncertainty.

consequences_if_true:
  - It may lead to a disregard for quantitative risk assessment in AI safety and ethics discussions, potentially overlooking valuable insights.
  - Decision-makers might rely more on intuition rather than structured probabilistic reasoning, possibly leading to less informed choices.
  - There could be a decrease in the effort to improve our methods for forecasting and understanding AI's future impact.

link_to_ai_safety: This argument emphasizes the importance of adapting our approach to AI safety discussions to better match human cognitive strengths.

simple_explanation: Trying to predict the impact of AI with precise probabilities is not only challenging but might not be the most effective approach. Our brains don't naturally work well with exact probabilities, especially for complex and uncertain futures. Moreover, knowing a specific probability doesn't necessarily change what we decide to do; we often stick to our plans regardless. It's more useful to focus on qualitative assessments and preparing for a range of possible outcomes rather than fixating on specific percentages.

examples:
  - Even with a 70% probability of rain, many people will still carry an umbrella or wear a raincoat as a precaution, showing that actions are often taken based on a range of outcomes rather than precise predictions.
  - Businesses frequently prepare for various future scenarios (like economic downturns or market expansions) without relying on precise probabilities, demonstrating a more qualitative, adaptable approach.
  - Historical predictions about technology, like the internet's impact on society, were wildly off in terms of specifics but broadly correct in sensing significant change, highlighting the limitations of precise probabilistic predictions.
