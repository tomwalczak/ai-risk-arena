claim: "Increasing intelligence, whether in humans or AI, does not inherently lead to misalignment with humanity."
premises:
  - claim: "Enhancing human intelligence through interventions such as intelligence enhancing drugs does not necessarily lead to a reduction in alignment with human values."
  - claim: "The challenge with AI alignment lies in ensuring that increasing intelligence does not compromise its alignment with human values."
counterargument_to:
  - Increasing intelligence in humans or AI inevitably leads to a divergence from human values and priorities.
  - A smarter AI or human will prioritize efficiency or logic over empathy and moral values, causing misalignment with humanity.

strongest_objjection:
  - The most significant objection might be that intelligence and value alignment are orthogonal concepts, implying that higher intelligence could lead to superior moral reasoning and better alignment with human values, not less.

consequences_if_true:
  - If true, then enhancing human intelligence through safe methods could lead to societal improvements without ethical degradation.
  - Advanced AI systems could be developed to solve complex problems without becoming threats to human values.
  - Efforts in AI alignment could focus more on the initial value embedding rather than limiting AI intelligence growth.

link_to_ai_safety: This argument underscores the importance of focusing on value alignment from the outset of AI development rather than constraining AI intelligence growth for safety.

simple_explanation: Enhancing intelligence, whether in humans through drugs or in AI through technological advancements, doesn't mean we're heading for a moral decline or misalignment with human values. Just as people like Oppenheimer, who was incredibly intelligent, didn't become less aligned with humanity, there's no reason to believe inherently that smarter AI would. Therefore, the challenge isn't about stopping intelligence but ensuring it grows with a strong foundation of human values.

examples:
  - The development of cognitive-enhancing drugs that improve decision-making and empathy in humans without compromising moral values.
  - AI systems designed to optimize energy usage in cities leading to both environmental and economic benefits without adverse societal impacts.
  - Historical figures of great intelligence, like Albert Einstein, who used their intellect for the betterment of humanity without losing touch with human values.
