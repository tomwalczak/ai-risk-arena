claim: "The evolution of AI capabilities is gradual, with capabilities accumulating incrementally."
premises:
  - claim: "AI's internal machinery develops incrementally, introducing new capabilities progressively."
  - claim: "The gradual nature of AI capability development is due to our limited understanding of its internal machinery."
counterargument_to:
  - The idea that AI will suddenly leap to superintelligence without warning.
  - The belief that AI development is a series of breakthroughs rather than a gradual process.

strongest_objection:
  - The objection that there have been instances of sudden leaps in AI capabilities, such as GPT-3, which seem to contradict the gradual nature of AI development.

consequences_if_true:
  - If AI capabilities accumulate incrementally, it implies a more predictable and manageable progression of AI development.
  - It suggests that there will be observable milestones and benchmarks that can signal the advancement towards more complex capabilities.
  - It implies that our current inability to fully understand or control AI's internal workings could be gradually overcome through continuous study and development.

link_to_ai_safety: Understanding the gradual evolution of AI capabilities is crucial for implementing effective safety measures and ensuring responsible progression towards advanced AI systems.

simple_explanation: The development of artificial intelligence is a step-by-step process, where new abilities are added little by little, much like how we learn. This slow and steady progress is largely because we're still figuring out how AI thinks and works. If we understand that AI grows its skills piece by piece, we can better prepare for what's coming next and make sure it's safe and beneficial for everyone.

examples:
  - The gradual improvement from simple chatbots to more complex systems like GPT-3, showcasing incremental advancements in natural language processing.
  - The evolution of autonomous driving technology, where each level of autonomy represents a significant, but gradual, step forward in capability.
  - The development of AI in games, moving from basic chess algorithms to more complex game-playing AIs like AlphaGo, which demonstrate incremental improvements in strategic thinking.
