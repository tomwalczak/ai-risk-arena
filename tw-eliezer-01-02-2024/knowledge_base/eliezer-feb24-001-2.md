claim: "The difficulty of AGI alignment stems from the lack of simple, robust solutions, not from impossibility."
premises:
  - claim: "With a future textbook of simple, effective ideas, we could quickly build aligned superintelligence."
  - claim: "Our current situation is perilous because we rely on inadequate solutions without access to straightforward, robust methods."
  - claim: "The issue lies in not being able to address critical challenges in time for the first attempt, rather than theoretical impossibilities."
counterargument_to:
  - The difficulty of AGI alignment is due to theoretical impossibilities rather than a current lack of effective solutions.
  - AGI alignment problems can be postponed or avoided by focusing on less challenging, safe AI problems.

strongest_objjection:
  - The complexity and unpredictability of AGI behavior might make it inherently impossible to find simple, robust solutions for alignment, regardless of future developments or discoveries.

consequences_if_true:
  - If a future textbook of simple, effective ideas for AGI alignment could be developed, it would significantly reduce the risk associated with the deployment of superintelligent AI systems.
  - Recognizing the lack of current solutions would incentivize a global push towards research and development in AGI safety, potentially averting catastrophic outcomes.
  - Acknowledging the perilous state of current AGI alignment efforts could lead to more collaborative and open efforts to find viable solutions.

link_to_ai_safety: This argument underscores the urgent need for research into simple, robust methods for AGI alignment to ensure the safe development of superintelligent AI systems.

simple_explanation: The main challenge in making artificial general intelligence (AGI) safe isn't that it's impossible to align its goals with ours; it's that we haven't yet discovered simple and effective ways to do so. Currently, we're stuck using complex, inadequate methods because straightforward, reliable solutions are out of our reach. If we could find these solutions, we could safely build and deploy superintelligent AI. However, the real danger lies in our inability to solve these critical challenges before we make our first, potentially disastrous attempt at creating AGI.

examples:
  - The development of antibiotics transformed medical treatment not because bacterial infections were unbeatable, but because the right, simple solution (antibiotics) had not been discovered before.
  - The invention of the airplane was not made possible by overcoming theoretical impossibilities but by finding the right principles of aerodynamics and engineering.
  - Cryptography has evolved not by confronting impossibilities but by developing robust, simple algorithms like RSA that previously didn't exist.
