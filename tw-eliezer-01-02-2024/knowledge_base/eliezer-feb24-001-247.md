claim: "There is concern about the pace of improvement in computing power."
premises:
  - claim: "A slower progression in Moore's Law would be preferable to mitigate risks associated with rapid AI advancement."
  - claim: "A complete halt in Moore's Law's progression would be celebrated to prevent unforeseen consequences of rapid technological advancement."
counterargument_to:
  - The belief that continuous and rapid advancement in computing power, as predicted by Moore's Law, is necessary and beneficial for technological progress and innovation.

strongest_objjection:
  - Slowing down or halting the progression of Moore's Law could significantly impede technological and economic growth, potentially leading to stagnation in various critical sectors such as healthcare, environmental monitoring, and space exploration.

consequences_if_true:
  - A more controlled pace of technological advancement might allow for better assessment and mitigation of risks associated with AI, leading to safer AI systems.
  - Halting Moore's Law could prevent potential existential threats from uncontrolled AI development, preserving human life and societal stability.
  - The slowing or stopping of Moore's Law might encourage innovation in alternative areas of technology, potentially leading to new breakthroughs outside of traditional computing.

link_to_ai_safety: This argument underscores the importance of pacing technological advancement to align with our capacity to ensure AI systems are developed safely and ethically.

simple_explanation: Imagine we're on a speeding train called "Technological Advancement," racing towards a future shaped by artificial intelligence. Some people believe this train should speed up to reach its destination as soon as possible. However, if we're heading towards a potentially dangerous place, wouldn't it be wiser to slow the train down or even stop it momentarily? This would give us time to make sure the path forward is safe, preventing the advancement of AI from causing unforeseen harm to humanity.

examples:
  - The development of nuclear energy and weapons required new safety protocols and international agreements to mitigate risks.
  - The introduction of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) into agriculture necessitated regulations and long-term health studies.
  - The rapid expansion of social media platforms has led to significant societal impacts, prompting calls for better oversight and ethical considerations.
