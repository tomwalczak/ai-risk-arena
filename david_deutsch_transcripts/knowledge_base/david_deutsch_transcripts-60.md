claim: "The memory and speed of human brains can be expanded."
premises:
  - claim: "All hardware limitations, like speed and memory capacity, can be augmented."
  - claim: "Augmentation allows humans to match any entity's computational speed."
counterargument_to:
  - "Human brains have fixed capacities and cannot integrate with technology to expand their capabilities."
  - "There are inherent limits to human cognitive enhancement."

strongest_objection:
  - "The complexity of the human brain and consciousness may not be fully replicable or augmentable through technology, especially in terms of subjective experiences like love or creativity."
  
consequences_if_true:
  - "If human brain memory and speed can be expanded, it could lead to significant cognitive enhancements, allowing humans to solve complex problems more efficiently."
  - "Augmented human intelligence could narrow the cognitive gap between humans and potential artificial general intelligence (AGI), fostering better integration or cooperation."
  - "Ethical, societal, and security implications would arise from the uneven access to or effects of cognitive enhancements."

link_to_ai_safety: Augmenting human brains to match the computational speed of entities suggests a pathway to ensuring humans can keep pace with or maintain oversight over AGI developments.

simple_explanation: If we can augment the hardware of the human brain to overcome limitations in memory and speed, we can essentially upgrade our cognitive capacities. This is like adding more RAM or a faster processor to a computer. Just as we can enhance computers to perform better, we can theoretically apply similar principles to the human brain. This could enable us not only to comprehend and process information at a speed comparable to advanced artificial intelligence but also expand our ability to understand complex concepts that are currently beyond our grasp.

examples:
  - "Installing a device that allows a person who cannot feel love due to a specific brain deficiency to experience love, demonstrating hardware augmentation."
  - "The use of cochlear implants to restore hearing in deaf individuals, which involves augmenting the brain's processing capabilities through technology."
  - "Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) that enable paralyzed individuals to control devices with their thoughts, hinting at the potential for direct cognitive enhancement."
