claim: "Education should be viewed as a process of trial and error, not mere instruction."
premises:
  - claim: "This approach fosters creativity and the ability to generate new knowledge, applying equally to programming AGIs and educating humans."
counterargument_to:
  - Education should be focused on instruction and memorization.
  - Learning is best achieved through direct teaching rather than experimentation.

strongest_objection:
  - This approach might lead to a slower acquisition of foundational knowledge, as trial and error can be inefficient.
  - It could be argued that not all subjects lend themselves well to a trial and error approach, such as those requiring safety considerations or immediate proficiency.

consequences_if_true:
  - It would necessitate a radical overhaul of current educational systems to accommodate more exploratory and experimental learning environments.
  - Students would develop stronger critical thinking and problem-solving skills, becoming more adept at navigating complex and uncertain situations.
  - There could be an increase in innovation and creativity across various fields, as individuals trained in this manner seek novel solutions and approaches.

link_to_ai_safety: This argument underscores the importance of creativity and error-correction in both human and AGI learning processes, suggesting that fostering these capacities could be key to developing safe and beneficial AGIs.

simple_explanation: Education, when seen as a process of trial and error, allows learners to engage with the material actively, encouraging creativity and the development of new knowledge. This method mirrors how we envision programming AGIs, focusing on conjecture and criticism rather than rote learning. By embracing mistakes as part of the learning journey, both humans and AGIs can achieve a deeper understanding and capability to innovate, making this approach crucial for future advancements in any field, including AI.

examples:
  - In programming, especially in AGI development, trial and error is a fundamental part of creating effective and innovative solutions.
  - Scientific research often relies on hypothesis testing, experimentation, and revision, embodying the trial and error learning process.
  - The process of learning a new language, where making mistakes and receiving feedback significantly contribute to fluency development.
