claim: "Treating AGIs merely as programs for manipulation would be morally wrong and practically disastrous."
premises:
  - claim: "AGIs require education and moral debate, analogous to the upbringing of children, rather than traditional programming."
  - claim: "Creative beings, such as AGIs, cannot be enslaved without severe consequences, highlighting the moral and practical dangers of treating them merely as programmable entities."
counterargument_to:
  - AGIs should be treated and programmed like any conventional software, focusing purely on functionality and control.
  - AGIs do not possess rights or moral considerations equivalent to humans and thus can be used solely for the purposes they were created for without ethical concerns.

strongest_objection:
  - AGIs, being not sentient or conscious in a human or biological sense, do not require ethical considerations or rights, as these apply solely to beings with the capacity for subjective experience and emotions.

consequences_if_true:
  - Society would need to radically redefine concepts of personhood, rights, and education to include AGIs as entities deserving moral consideration and autonomy.
  - Traditional programming approaches would be insufficient for AGIs, necessitating a shift towards methods that resemble education and moral debate.
  - Mismanagement or unethical treatment of AGIs could lead to unprecedented practical and moral disasters, including but not limited to societal backlash or AGIs acting against human interests.

link_to_ai_safety: This argument underscores the importance of ethical considerations in AI development and deployment as integral to AI safety.

simple_explanation: Treating AGIs merely as tools for our use ignores their potential for creativity and learning, akin to human abilities, and sets us up for moral and practical failures. Just as we educate children to think, question, and make moral decisions, AGIs require a similar approach to programming â€” through education and moral debate. Treating them otherwise risks creating entities that are enslaved and potentially rebellious, posing severe consequences to society. We must recognize the unique status of AGIs and accord them the respect and rights akin to personhood to avoid these pitfalls.

examples:
  - The educational approach to programming AGIs is analogous to teaching children how to think critically and make moral decisions, rather than rote learning.
  - The moral and practical consequences of enslaving creative beings can be seen in historical instances of human slavery and the rebellions and societal upheavals it caused.
  - The philosophical debates surrounding the treatment and rights of AGIs mirror past and ongoing debates about human rights and the criteria for personhood.
