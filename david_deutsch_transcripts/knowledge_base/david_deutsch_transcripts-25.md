claim: "The real challenge with AGIs is ensuring that intelligences with morally good ideas always defeat evil ones."
premises:
  - claim: "The battle between good and evil ideas is universal and not unique to AGIs, continuing regardless of the hardware it runs on."
  - claim: "Human conception of 'good' is fallible and requires continual improvement to ensure morally good ideas prevail."
counterargument_to:
  - AGIs, by virtue of their artificial nature, can be inherently programmed to be morally good or evil.
  - Human intervention or programming can ensure AGIs always follow ethical guidelines without fail.

strongest_objection:
  - Human ethics are diverse and evolving, making it challenging to define universally "morally good" ideas that AGIs should follow.

consequences_if_true:
  - Societies must invest in continual philosophical and ethical discourse to adapt and guide the moral development of AGIs.
  - Education and programming of AGIs must prioritize critical thinking and ethical reasoning over rote learning or fixed behavior patterns.
  - A dynamic framework for AGI rights and personhood will be necessary, considering their unique abilities and challenges.

link_to_ai_safety: This argument underscores the importance of ethical and philosophical progress alongside technical advancements in AI safety.

simple_explanation: The real challenge with AGIs isn't just creating them but ensuring they champion morally good ideas over evil ones. This battle of ethics isn't new; it's as old as humanity itself and doesn't depend on whether intelligence resides in a biological brain or a computer. Since our understanding of what is 'good' is always evolving, we must continually refine our ethical frameworks. This means that educating AGIs, much like educating humans, should focus on fostering a capacity for critical thinking and moral reasoning, rather than merely programming them with a static set of rules.

examples:
  - Just as human societies have evolved from accepting slavery to recognizing it as morally reprehensible, AGIs' moral frameworks must also be capable of evolution.
  - The challenge of multiple AGI copies raises ethical questions akin to cloning debates in biology, demanding nuanced understanding of personhood and rights.
  - The transition from viewing education as instruction to seeing it as a process of conjecture and criticism reflects the need for AGIs to learn and adapt ethically.
