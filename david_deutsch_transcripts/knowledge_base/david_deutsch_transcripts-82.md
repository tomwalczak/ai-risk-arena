claim: "Prioritizing research into making laboratories more secure is essential for continuing open-ended scientific progress in the face of existential risks, such as those posed by gain-of-function studies."
premises:
  - claim: "Halting gain-of-function research due to potential risks hinders the discovery of new knowledge, making the management of research priorities a more effective approach."
  - claim: "The potential for discovering knowledge on how to stop dangerous pathogens justifies the continuation of gain-of-function research, with an emphasis on improving lab security."
counterargument_to:
  - "Gain-of-function research should be halted entirely due to the existential risks it poses."
  - "Improvements in lab security cannot sufficiently mitigate the risks associated with gain-of-function research."

strongest_objection:
  - "Enhancing lab security may not fully prevent the misuse or accidental release of pathogens, potentially leading to a catastrophic event."

consequences_if_true:
  - "Scientific progress in understanding and combating dangerous pathogens will continue in a safer manner."
  - "The existential risks posed by gain-of-function research will be significantly reduced."
  - "Confidence in conducting high-risk research will increase, underpinned by robust safety measures."

link_to_ai_safety: This argument parallels AI safety discussions, emphasizing proactive risk management and security improvements to enable the safe continuation of potentially hazardous but beneficial research.

simple_explanation: Prioritizing research into enhancing lab security is crucial because stopping gain-of-function research altogether stops scientific progress, which could help us fight dangerous pathogens. Instead, better safety measures can allow this important work to continue without posing a significant risk to humanity. It's about managing risks in a way that doesn't halt progress but ensures it's done safely, reflecting a balanced approach to advancing science while safeguarding against existential threats.

examples:
  - "The development of enhanced biosafety level (BSL) protocols for handling highly contagious viruses."
  - "Implementation of fail-safes and redundancies in lab designs to prevent accidental pathogen release."
  - "Establishing international standards for gain-of-function research to ensure global adherence to best practices in lab security."
