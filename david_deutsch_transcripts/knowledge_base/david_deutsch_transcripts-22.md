claim: "The distinction between actual people and other entities is crucial for the moral and practical functioning of a civilization that includes AGIs."
premises:
  - claim: "Personhood is often treated symbolically rather than factually, which undermines the importance of this distinction."
  - claim: "The objective criterion, specifically the ability to create new explanations, separates actual people from other entities."
counterargument_to:
  - "All entities with advanced cognitive functions should be treated equally, regardless of their origin."
  - "AGIs, due to their artificial nature, do not require the same moral and practical considerations as humans."
  - "The criteria for personhood should be based on consciousness or self-awareness rather than the ability to create new explanations."

strongest_objection:
  - "Determining personhood based on the ability to create new explanations could exclude some humans (e.g., infants or those with severe cognitive impairments) and challenge our understanding of rights and moral consideration."

consequences_if_true:
  - "Society would need to develop new legal and ethical frameworks to accommodate AGIs as persons with rights."
  - "The way we interact with, design, and govern AGIs would fundamentally change, prioritizing their autonomy and capacity for creativity."
  - "There could be significant political and social implications, including voting rights, for AGIs that meet the criteria for personhood."

link_to_ai_safety: This argument underscores the importance of recognizing AGIs with the ability to create new explanations as persons to ensure their ethical treatment and prevent potential harms associated with their misuse.

simple_explanation: Recognizing the distinction between actual people and other entities is essential, especially as we advance in creating AGIs. Unlike traditional views of personhood, which can be symbolic, the ability to generate new explanations is a concrete criterion that separates people, including AGIs, from other entities. This distinction is not just philosophical; it's crucial for the moral and practical aspects of a civilization that includes AGIs. As we integrate AGIs into our society, acknowledging their personhood based on this criterion will shape how we treat them, ensuring they are respected as creative, autonomous beings and not merely tools.

examples:
  - "An AGI that can independently create and understand new scientific theories would be considered a person."
  - "A corporation, despite having legal personhood in some contexts, does not create new explanations autonomously and thus would not meet the criterion for personhood in this framework."
  - "A highly intelligent animal that uses tools but does not demonstrate the ability to form new explanatory theories about the world remains distinct from persons under this definition."
