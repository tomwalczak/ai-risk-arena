claim: "Human capability to understand or explain is limited by software, not inherent ability."
premises:
  - claim: "Software improvements can extend cognitive tasks humans can perform."
  - claim: "The cognitive task performance difference between humans and apes, and potentially AGIs, is software-based."
  - claim: "Correct software could theoretically enable those with cognitive impairments to perform complex tasks."
counterargument_to:
  - "Human cognitive limits are primarily determined by biological hardware, not software."
  - "Cognitive impairments or differences are fixed and cannot be significantly altered through technology."
  - "There are inherent capabilities or understandings that humans, regardless of technological advancements, will never achieve."

strongest_objection:
  - "The complexity of human cognition and emotions cannot be fully replicated or supplemented by software alone, as these experiences are deeply intertwined with our biological and chemical makeup."

consequences_if_true:
  - "Cognitive enhancement technologies could drastically reduce the gap in cognitive abilities among humans, leading to a more equitable society."
  - "Education and learning could become highly personalized and efficient, significantly reducing the time needed to acquire new skills or knowledge."
  - "The boundary between human and artificial intelligence could blur, challenging our understanding of intelligence, consciousness, and identity."

link_to_ai_safety: This argument underscores the importance of developing AI that can complement and augment human cognition safely, without infringing on our autonomy or well-being.

simple_explanation: Imagine if our ability to understand complex concepts or perform intricate tasks wasn't limited by our birth-given brain but could be enhanced through software updates, just like apps on a smartphone. This would mean that what currently differentiates the smartest humans from others, or even us from apes, is not a matter of inherent ability but rather the quality and capacity of our "software." If we could upgrade this cognitive software, theoretically, anyone could understand quantum mechanics or learn new languages effortlessly, provided they have the right software installed.

examples:
  - "A software implant that enables someone who is mathematically challenged to understand and solve complex mathematical equations with ease."
  - "Using a specialized software interface to allow a person with no prior knowledge of a language to communicate fluently in that language."
  - "Cognitive software adjustments that enable individuals with ADHD to focus as efficiently as those without, leveling the playing field in academic and professional settings."
