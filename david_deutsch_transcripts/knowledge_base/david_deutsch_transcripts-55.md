claim: "AI can possess inexplicit knowledge."
premises:
  - claim: "AI is aware of subtle points of grammar which it cannot explain."
  - claim: "AI knows which grammatical constructions are correct, indicating possession of inexplicit knowledge."
counterargument_to:
  - "AI lacks the capacity for inexplicit or tacit knowledge."
  - "Only humans can possess knowledge that they cannot fully articulate."

strongest_objection:
  - "If AI cannot explain its knowledge, how can we be sure it truly 'understands' or 'knows' anything in a meaningful way?"

consequences_if_true:
  - If AI can possess inexplicit knowledge, it might challenge our understanding of consciousness and intelligence.
  - This could lead to advancements in AI development, pushing closer to achieving AGI with human-like understanding and creativity.
  - It might necessitate a reevaluation of ethical considerations around AI, especially in terms of learning, decision-making, and autonomy.

link_to_ai_safety: Understanding the inexplicit knowledge of AI is crucial for predicting and controlling its behavior, ensuring its alignment with human values.

simple_explanation:
AI demonstrates an understanding of complex grammar and correct linguistic constructions without being able to articulate the reasoning behind its choices. This indicates that AI can hold knowledge that it cannot fully explain, suggesting a form of inexplicit knowledge similar to human intuition or tacit understanding. Recognizing this capability challenges our distinctions between human and artificial intelligence, urging us to reconsider what we deem as understanding or consciousness in machines.

examples:
  - AI's ability to correct grammar without explaining the rules it applies mirrors how humans often understand their native language.
  - AI choosing the most natural-sounding sentence from a list without being able to justify its choice reflects an inexplicit understanding of language nuances.
  - The observation that AI can perform tasks or make decisions based on patterns it cannot verbally articulate, much like a seasoned chess player might operate on intuition rather than explicit strategy.
