claim: "The current approach to handling threats does not pose an existential risk."
premises:
  - claim: "Handling of both external and internal threats is flawed but not to an existential level."
  - claim: "The difficulty in predicting future advancements over long periods casts uncertainty on existential risk levels."
counterargument_to:
  - "The current approach to handling threats poses an existential risk to humanity."

strongest_objection:
  - "The argument underestimates the potential for current threat management strategies to fail catastrophically, especially with emerging technologies like AI."

consequences_if_true:
  - "It would imply that current safety and risk management strategies are sufficient to prevent existential threats."
  - "This perspective could reduce the urgency and resources allocated to improving how we handle and mitigate risks."
  - "A complacency towards existential risks could develop, potentially leaving us unprepared for unforeseen threats."

link_to_ai_safety: The argument indirectly supports the importance of continuous improvement in AI safety measures by highlighting the unpredictability of future advancements.

simple_explanation: The argument suggests that while our current methods of managing threats, both from within and without, are imperfect, they are not so flawed as to endanger our very existence. It also points out that the unpredictable nature of future advancements adds a layer of uncertainty to any claims about existential risks. This perspective encourages a balanced view on risk management, urging for improvements without succumbing to despair or fear.

examples:
  - "The handling of nuclear weapons during the Cold War, where despite close calls, strategic management prevented catastrophe."
  - "The rapid development and deployment of COVID-19 vaccines, demonstrating our ability to respond to global health threats."
  - "The ongoing efforts in AI ethics and safety research, aiming to mitigate potential risks associated with advanced artificial intelligence."
