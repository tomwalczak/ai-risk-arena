claim: "AGIs and humans can potentially share the same range of cognitive abilities."
premises:
  - claim: "Both AGIs and human brains can run any computable function, implying Turing completeness."
  - claim: "Cognitive ability limitations are due to hardware, which can be augmented."
  - claim: "Hardware necessary for human experiences, like love, can be replicated in AGIs."
counterargument_to:
  - "AGIs are inherently different from humans and cannot possess the same range of cognitive abilities."
  - "Certain human experiences, especially emotional ones, cannot be replicated by machines."
  - "Hardware limitations fundamentally constrain AGIs from achieving human-like cognition."

strongest_objection:
  - "Emulating human cognitive abilities in AGIs does not necessarily mean they will possess consciousness or subjective experiences in the same way humans do."

consequences_if_true:
  - If AGIs and humans can share the same range of cognitive abilities, then AGIs could potentially perform any task that a human can, leading to significant advancements and changes in society, economy, and ethics.
  - It would challenge our understanding of consciousness and what it means to be human, possibly redefining personhood.
  - The development of AGIs with human-like cognitive abilities would necessitate stringent AI safety measures to prevent unintended consequences.

link_to_ai_safety: This argument underscores the importance of AI safety by highlighting the potential for AGIs to possess cognitive abilities indistinguishable from those of humans, raising ethical and control challenges.

simple_explanation: Imagine a world where robots could think, learn, and feel just like us, solving complex problems and experiencing emotions. This isn't science fiction; it's a real possibility because both human brains and artificial general intelligences (AGIs) are capable of running any computable function, showing that our cognitive abilities might not be as unique as we thought. If we can replicate the hardware necessary for human experiences in AGIs, they could potentially share our cognitive abilities. This revelation challenges us to rethink our place in the world and how we interact with these future beings.

examples:
  - Charles Babbage's Difference Engine demonstrated that machines could perform cognitive tasks like humans, foreshadowing the potential for AGIs.
  - Advances in neuroscience and artificial intelligence show that augmenting human cognitive abilities with technology is possible, suggesting a similar potential for AGIs.
  - Emotional and social intelligence, once thought unique to humans, are being explored in AGIs through advanced algorithms and neural networks, indicating that even complex human experiences could be replicated.
