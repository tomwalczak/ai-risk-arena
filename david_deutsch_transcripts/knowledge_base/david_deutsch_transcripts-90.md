claim: "Conditioning short-term goals on long-term objectives is perilous."
premises:
  - claim: "Pursuing a flawed long-term goal leads to recognition of the mistake too late for correction."
    example: "Corrective measures are unfeasible on a 50-year timescale, rendering the strategy highly risky."
  - claim: "The subordination of immediate goals to distant ones hinders the ability to perform timely corrections."
counterargument_to:
  - "Setting long-term goals is essential for meaningful progress."
  - "Long-term objectives provide direction and motivation for short-term actions."
  - "Achieving significant achievements requires long-term planning and vision."

strongest_objection:
  - "Without long-term goals, efforts can become directionless and lack coherence, potentially leading to inefficiency or the pursuit of trivial short-term achievements."

consequences_if_true:
  - "Planning and strategy development would need to emphasize flexibility and adaptability over rigid long-term goal setting."
  - "Organizations and individuals might prioritize developing systems for rapid detection and correction of errors in direction."
  - "There could be a shift towards more iterative or agile approaches in various fields, including policy making, business strategy, and personal development."

link_to_ai_safety: This argument highlights the importance of adaptability and error correction in goal setting, which is crucial for the safe development of AI to avoid committing to a flawed trajectory that cannot be corrected in time.

simple_explanation: Relying too much on long-term objectives can be risky because it makes it hard to change course if you realize your goal was flawed. Imagine dedicating decades to achieving something, only to find out it was the wrong thing to aim for, and now it's too late to fix it. It's like following a map to a treasure island, only to discover the map was wrong after you've already arrived. This is why it's important to make sure our short-term goals can be adjusted easily, so we can stay flexible and correct our course as we learn more.

examples:
  - "A company investing heavily in a technology that becomes obsolete before it can dominate the market, unable to pivot due to the scale of the investment."
  - "Political strategies that commit to long-term policies without room for adjustment based on societal changes or new evidence, leading to ineffective or harmful outcomes."
  - "Educational or career paths chosen based on predictions of future demand that turn out to be inaccurate, leaving individuals unprepared for the actual needs of the job market."
