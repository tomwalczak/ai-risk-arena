claim: "The core functionality that distinguishes human brains from all other physical systems cannot be programmed by current techniques."
premises:
  - claim: "This core functionality is qualitatively different from all functionalities of other physical systems."
  - claim: "Current programming techniques cannot specify this functionality as they can with attributes of other computer programs."
counterargument_to:
  - "Human cognitive abilities and consciousness can be fully replicated with advanced artificial intelligence and computational systems."

strongest_objection:
  - "The universality of computation implies that any process, including those in the human brain, can theoretically be emulated by a computer program, given enough time and resources."

consequences_if_true:
  - "It would highlight a fundamental gap in our understanding of human cognition and consciousness, necessitating a philosophical and scientific breakthrough to bridge this gap."
  - "Current approaches to developing artificial general intelligence (AGI) would need to be fundamentally rethought, potentially redirecting the focus of AI research."
  - "It may impose ethical and existential considerations regarding the uniqueness of human intelligence and the role of AI in society."

link_to_ai_safety: This argument underscores the importance of understanding the unique aspects of human cognition in developing safe and beneficial AI systems.

simple_explanation: The essence of the argument is that there's something inherently unique and currently indefinable about human brains that sets them apart from any other physical system, including the most advanced computers and AI. Despite the incredible advancements in technology and programming, we're still unable to replicate or program the core functionality of human creativity and consciousness. This isn't just a technical limitation; it's a profound gap in our understanding of both computation and human cognition. In essence, what makes us human, our ability to generate new, original ideas and understandings, remains beyond the reach of current AI and computational theories.

examples:
  - "Creativity: The human ability to produce new, original art, literature, and scientific theories."
  - "Consciousness: Our self-awareness and subjective experience of the world, which is qualitatively different from any known computer program."
  - "Emotional depth and moral reasoning: Human emotions and moral judgments involve complexities that current AI cannot authentically replicate."
