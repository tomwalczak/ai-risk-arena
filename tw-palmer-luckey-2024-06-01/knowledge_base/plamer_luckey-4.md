claim: "AI in the hands of bad people refers to the various ways humans could use AI to develop and deploy destructive technologies."
premises:
  - claim: "AI could be instrumental in creating targeted biological weapons."
  - claim: "Advancements in AI could lower technical barriers, enabling even small groups to develop bioweapons aimed at specific genetic profiles."
counterargument_to:
  - "AI technology inherently promotes global safety and stability."
  - "AI is only dangerous when it reaches superintelligence levels."

strongest_objection:
  - "AI also has significant potential for defensive applications that could mitigate these threats, such as advanced disease detection and neutralization systems."

consequences_if_true:
  - "Increased proliferation of bioweapons targeted at specific genetic markers, leading to new forms of warfare and terrorism."
  - "Democratization of dangerous technologies, enabling smaller groups or even individuals to wield unprecedented destructive power."
  - "Shift in global security dynamics, necessitating new forms of international cooperation and surveillance to counteract the misuse of AI."

link_to_ai_safety:
  - This argument highlights critical aspects of AI safety, focusing on misuse by humans rather than autonomous decisions made by AI itself.

simple_explanation:
  - When discussing the dangers of AI, it's crucial to consider not just the technology's sophistication but how it can be misused. AI, even at current levels of development, could help bad actors create biological weapons that target specific genetic profiles. This makes even narrow AI a substantial threat if used maliciously. As AI technology becomes more accessible, the risk of its misuse in creating targeted bioweapons also increases, posing a significant danger not just to specific groups but to global stability at large.

examples:
  - Use of AI by extremist groups to develop bioweapons that target specific ethnicities based on genetic differences.
  - Small rogue states using AI algorithms to enhance the lethality of existing biological agents to be used in warfare.
  - Non-state actors leveraging AI to design pathogens that could bypass current medical defenses, creating targeted outbreaks.
