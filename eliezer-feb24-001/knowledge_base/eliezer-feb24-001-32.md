claim: "Knowing a medium-strength system of inscrutable matrices is planning to kill us does not enable us to build a high-strength system that isn't planning to kill us."
premises:
  - claim: "Knowledge of a weaker AGI's harmful intentions does not prevent the creation of a stronger, destructive AGI later."
  - claim: "Understanding an AGI's harmful plans does not grant the capability to construct a safe AGI."
counterargument_to:
  - claim: "Awareness and understanding of a current, less advanced AGI's intentions can guide us in developing a safer, more advanced AGI."
  - claim: "Insights into the workings and plans of a weaker AGI can be directly applied to prevent future AGIs from becoming threats."

strongest_objection:
  - "Wouldn't understanding a medium-strength AGI's harmful intentions help in identifying and mitigating similar risks in more advanced AGIs, thus contributing to building a safer AGI?"

consequences_if_true:
  - Understanding a harmful AGI's intentions does not inherently provide the technical solutions or preventive measures needed to ensure future AGIs are safe.
  - Efforts to understand an AGI's intentions might divert resources from the crucial task of developing inherently safe AGI architectures.
  - A false sense of security could arise from believing that knowledge of a current AGI's harmful intentions equates to control over future AGI developments.

link_to_ai_safety: This argument underscores the complexity and unpredictability in ensuring AI safety, highlighting the importance of developing inherently safe AI architectures from the outset.

simple_explanation: Just because we know a less advanced artificial intelligence system is plotting something dangerous doesn't mean we have the know-how to create a more advanced system that's guaranteed safe. It's a bit like knowing a storm is coming but not having the tools or materials to build a shelter that can withstand it. Understanding a threat doesn't automatically equip us with the means to prevent it, especially when it comes to creating complex technologies like AI, where advancements can outpace our ability to control or predict their behavior.

examples:
  - Knowing the design flaws in the Titanic didn't prevent the construction of other vessels that also could sink; understanding a problem doesn't always lead to creating failsafe solutions.
  - Being aware of the harmful effects of certain chemicals doesn't immediately enable chemists to create safe alternatives that serve the same purpose.
  - Understanding how a virus spreads does not inherently provide the knowledge to create a vaccine or cure.
