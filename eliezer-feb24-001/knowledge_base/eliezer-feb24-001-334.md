link_to_ai_safety: This argument underscores the importance of minimizing human biases in the development and management of AI, to prevent ego-driven errors in judgment that could lead to unsafe outcomes.

simple_explanation: When we let our egos get in the way, we spend too much time defending our ideas and questioning our self-worth, which distracts us from making clear-headed decisions. It's not about how much ego we have, but rather how we let it influence our decision-making. By focusing on the process—what worked, what didn't, and why—we can make better predictions and decisions without letting personal pride cloud our judgment. This approach not only leads to more accurate assessments but also fosters an environment where learning from mistakes is valued over defending bruised egos.

examples:
  - "A scientist stubbornly defending a disproven hypothesis due to years of personal investment, ignoring new evidence."
  - "A business leader refusing to pivot from a failing strategy because admitting error would mean losing face."
  - "A politician sticking to harmful policies to avoid giving opponents the satisfaction of a concession, despite clear evidence of negative outcomes."
