claim: "There are potential Hail Mary strategies for human enhancement and AI safety"
premises:
  - claim: "Training humans to be saner through neurofeedback could mitigate irrationality"
  - claim: "Deploying AI to promote rational thinking on social media could spread sanity"
  - claim: "Brain emulation and enhancement, while risky, do not present the utter lethality of artificial intelligence"
counterargument_to:
  - "Human enhancement and AI strategies for promoting rationality and safety are futile or too risky."
  - "Artificial intelligence poses unique and insurmountable risks that cannot be mitigated through human intelligence enhancement."

strongest_objection:
  - "Enhancing human intelligence or deploying AI to promote rationality could have unforeseen negative consequences, including increasing the power differential between enhanced and non-enhanced humans, and the misuse of AI in spreading disinformation or manipulation on social media."

consequences_if_true:
  - "Training humans to be saner through neurofeedback could lead to a significant reduction in societal irrationality and decision-making flaws."
  - "AI-driven promotion of rational thinking on social media could create a more informed and less polarized public discourse."
  - "Brain emulation and enhancement, despite their risks, might offer a path to a more controlled and benevolent form of artificial intelligence, reducing existential risk."

link_to_ai_safety: This argument directly links to AI safety by proposing innovative methods to enhance human cognition and deploy AI in ways that could offset the existential risks posed by uncontrolled artificial intelligence development.

simple_explanation: Imagine we're in a scenario where the future of humanity is at stake because of the risks posed by superintelligent AI. In a last-ditch effort, or what's called a "Hail Mary" strategy, we could try enhancing human intelligence. This could be done by training people to think more rationally using neurofeedback while they're in MRIs or by using advanced AI to gently nudge people towards rational thinking on social media. Though these ideas sound like they're from a sci-fi novel, they represent real possibilities that could help us navigate the dangerous waters of AI development by making us smarter and less prone to irrationality.

examples:
  - "Using neurofeedback techniques to train people to recognize and avoid cognitive biases, thereby enhancing rational decision-making."
  - "Deploying AI systems on platforms like Twitter to encourage constructive and rational dialogue, effectively countering the spread of misinformation."
  - "Developing brain emulation technologies that allow for the enhancement of human cognitive capabilities, potentially leading to safer and more ethical forms of artificial intelligence."
