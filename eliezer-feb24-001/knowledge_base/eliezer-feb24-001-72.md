claim: "Humans have become increasingly orthogonal to the evolutionary processes that produced them."
premises:
  - claim: "As humans gain intelligence, they explore options further removed from those in ancestral environments."
  - claim: "Human desire for offspring is motivated by the wish for children similar to themselves, not necessarily for genetic replication."
counterargument_to:
  - Humans are still fundamentally driven by the same evolutionary processes that shaped their ancestors.
  - Human advancements and behaviors can be entirely explained through the lens of natural selection and genetic replication.

strongest_objjection:
  - The basic human instincts and desires, such as survival and reproduction, are still deeply rooted in evolutionary processes, suggesting that humans cannot be fully orthogonal to these processes.
  
consequences_if_true:
  - If humans are increasingly orthogonal to evolutionary processes, it may indicate a shift in the fundamental drivers of human behavior, moving away from purely biological imperatives.
  - This divergence could lead to the development of societal structures and technologies that are not necessarily aligned with our evolutionary predispositions.
  - It could also imply that future human evolution might be more significantly shaped by cultural and technological factors than by biological evolution.

link_to_ai_safety: This argument highlights the complexity of human motivation and the potential for misalignment between AI objectives and human values, underscoring the importance of aligning AI development with a deep understanding of human desires beyond mere survival.

simple_explanation: As humans grow smarter and society advances, we're starting to make choices that our ancestors wouldn't have even imagined, from choosing not to have children to dedicating our lives to causes that don't directly help us survive or reproduce. This means we're moving away from the straightforward evolutionary drives that led to our creation, like surviving long enough to pass on our genes. Instead, we're motivated by desires for personal fulfillment, societal impact, and the creation of a legacy that might not necessarily involve genetic offspring. This shift could significantly affect how we plan for the future, including how we design and control artificial intelligence.

examples:
  - The increasing popularity of voluntary childlessness among individuals in developed countries, driven by personal choice rather than biological imperatives.
  - The dedication of significant resources to space exploration, a venture that offers no immediate survival advantage to individuals or their genes.
  - The rise of altruistic behaviors that benefit unrelated individuals or even other species, without direct genetic gain for the benefactor.
