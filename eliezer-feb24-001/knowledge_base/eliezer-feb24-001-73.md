claim: "The preference for genetic replication over alternative procreation methods might diminish with increased intelligence."
premises:
  - claim: "Higher intelligence correlates with a greater openness to alternative procreation methods."
  - claim: "Should credible alternatives offer superior outcomes to traditional genetic replication, many would likely prefer these alternatives."
counterargument_to:
  - The notion that traditional genetic replication is the only or most desirable form of procreation.
  - The belief that intelligence level does not significantly influence openness to new technologies or methods, including in the realm of procreation.

strongest_objection:
  - The emotional and cultural significance of traditional procreation methods may outweigh the logical or intellectual appreciation for alternatives, regardless of intelligence level.

consequences_if_true:
  - A shift in societal norms regarding family and procreation, moving away from traditional genetic replication towards more technologically advanced or alternative methods.
  - Potential for significant genetic diversity or enhancement if alternative methods allow for improved outcomes over traditional genetic replication.
  - A reevaluation of ethical standards and legal frameworks surrounding procreation and parenting.

link_to_ai_safety: This argument indirectly links to AI safety by highlighting how increased intelligence (potentially including AI-enhanced decision-making) might lead to more rational and potentially safer choices in critical areas of human life, including procreation.

simple_explanation: As people become smarter, they're more likely to consider and even prefer new ways of having children, especially if these new methods promise better outcomes than the traditional way of passing on genes. This isn't just about being open-minded; it's about making decisions that could lead to healthier or otherwise improved offspring. So, as our collective intelligence and technological capabilities grow, we might see a shift in how society thinks about and approaches procreation.

examples:
  - In vitro fertilization (IVF) and genetic screening technologies, which were once considered novel and controversial, are now widely accepted and used by many seeking to have children.
  - The growing interest in gene editing technologies like CRISPR for eliminating hereditary diseases before a child is born.
  - The speculative future use of artificial wombs, which could offer new procreation options beyond traditional pregnancy.
