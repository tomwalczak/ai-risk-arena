claim: "AGI alignment is lethally difficult."
premises:
  - claim: "Ensuring AGI does not lead to significant human casualties is the main challenge, not achieving perfect alignment."
  - claim: "Using current techniques, it's overly ambitious to prevent AGI from causing widespread harm."
  - claim: "The fundamental challenge is to significantly increase the chances of human survival in the face of AGI development."
counterargument_to:
  - "AGI alignment can be achieved with sufficient research and development."
  - "The risks associated with AGI are manageable and can be mitigated effectively."

strongest_objection:
  - "Technological progress and innovative solutions could potentially make AGI alignment more feasible than currently believed."

consequences_if_true:
  - "Significant resources must be allocated towards solving AGI alignment to prevent catastrophic outcomes."
  - "The development of AGI might need to be slowed or heavily regulated to ensure alignment challenges are addressed."
  - "A shift in focus towards ensuring human survival as the primary goal in AGI development is necessary."

link_to_ai_safety: This argument underscores the critical importance of prioritizing human safety in the development of AGI.

simple_explanation: Aligning Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) with human safety is not about achieving a perfect understanding or control but ensuring it doesn't lead to widespread human casualties. Currently, our techniques fall short of guaranteeing such safety, making the task seem insurmountably difficult. The main goal is to significantly increase our chances of surviving AGI's development, even if that means accepting that some risks of harm cannot be completely eliminated.

examples:
  - "The difficulty of ensuring an AGI won't turn technologies against humans in ways we can't predict."
  - "The challenge of creating AGI that can perform superhuman tasks without inadvertently causing harm due to misalignment."
  - "The historical precedent of technological advancements outpacing ethical and safety considerations, leading to unintended consequences."
