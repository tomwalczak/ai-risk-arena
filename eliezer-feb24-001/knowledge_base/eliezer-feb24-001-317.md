claim: "The correlation between what humans find beautiful and what has been historically useful may not align with the outcomes of superintelligent AI."
premises:
  - claim: "Early biologists believed it was useful and beautiful for organisms to restrain their own reproduction for long-term survival."
  - claim: "Natural selection disproved this by favoring genes that were more prevalent in the next generation, regardless of resource restraint."
counterargument_to:
  - "Humans have an inherent ability to predict and align with the outcomes of superintelligent AI based on historical patterns of utility and beauty."
  - "The things humans find beautiful are inherently useful in a way that will be similarly recognized and optimized by superintelligent AI."

strongest_objection:
  - "The argument assumes that historical patterns of beauty and utility will not evolve or adapt in the context of superintelligent AI, ignoring the potential for AI to develop new definitions of utility that align with human values."

consequences_if_true:
  - "If the correlation between human perceptions of beauty and utility does not align with superintelligent AI outcomes, AI might prioritize actions that humans find detrimental or unethical."
  - "The divergence in outcomes could lead to unintended consequences in AI behavior, potentially endangering human well-being or survival."
  - "This misalignment might necessitate a reevaluation of how we teach AI to recognize and prioritize values, emphasizing a deeper understanding of human ethics and aesthetics."

link_to_ai_safety: This argument underscores the importance of aligning AI's optimization goals with human values to ensure the safety and beneficial outcomes of superintelligent AI.

simple_explanation: Historically, humans have believed that what is beautiful is also useful, and this principle guided early biological theories. For example, early biologists thought it was both beautiful and useful for organisms to limit their reproduction to ensure long-term survival. However, natural selection often favored traits that simply made an organism more likely to reproduce, without regard for long-term sustainability. This historical mismatch suggests that our intuitive sense of what is beautiful and useful may not align with the optimization processes of superintelligent AI, potentially leading to outcomes we didn't anticipate or desire.

examples:
  - "Peacocks' tail feathers are considered beautiful by humans and are useful for attracting mates, but in terms of survival, they're a liability due to their conspicuousness to predators."
  - "The human appreciation for landscapes with water and trees is thought to be linked to ancient survival needs, yet a superintelligent AI might not prioritize preserving such landscapes if its objectives don't align with these aesthetic values."
  - "The Venus flytrap is admired for its unique beauty and ingenuity in trapping insects, yet from the perspective of superintelligent AI, optimizing for efficient nutrient capture might look drastically different."
