claim: "Retrospective financial rewards might better drive progress in AI alignment."
premises:
  - claim: "High-powered talents have a higher chance of making core contributions."
  - claim: "Predicting these talents is challenging, making retrospective rewards more effective."
counterargument_to:
  - "Prospective financial incentives are sufficient to attract talent into AI alignment research."
  - "The ability to predict which individuals will make significant contributions to AI alignment is reliable."

strongest_objection:
  - "Retrospective financial rewards might discourage early participation by individuals who cannot afford to work without immediate compensation."

consequences_if_true:
  - High-powered talents will be more motivated to join and contribute to AI alignment, knowing their contributions could be recognized and rewarded retrospectively.
  - This could lead to a more diverse set of approaches and innovations in AI alignment as individuals from various backgrounds might take the risk, hoping for future rewards.
  - It could shift the focus from short-term projects with immediate rewards to long-term, high-impact research.

link_to_ai_safety: Retrospective financial rewards could incentivize more researchers to focus on AI safety and alignment, potentially accelerating progress in these critical areas.

simple_explanation: Imagine you're working on a complex puzzle where the solution could help control powerful AI systems, making them safer for humanity. You're not sure if your idea will work, but if it does, it could be a game-changer. Now, knowing that you could be rewarded after proving your solution works, rather than being paid upfront based on a prediction that might not pan out, would likely encourage you and other bright minds to dive in, experiment, and potentially come up with groundbreaking solutions. This is the essence of why retrospective financial rewards might be a better way to drive progress in AI alignment.

examples:
  - Anthropic’s success with Constitutional AI and its recognition after proving effective in AI alignment serves as a precedent for rewarding impactful contributions retrospectively.
  - The Nobel Prize awards scientists for their groundbreaking contributions to humanity often years after their initial discovery, highlighting the effectiveness of retrospective recognition and reward.
  - Crowdsourcing challenges, like the XPRIZE, offer substantial rewards for solving specific problems, only paying out once solutions have been proven to work, thus attracting diverse talents who believe in their innovative solutions.
