claim: "Breeding dogs into very nice humans would be easier than achieving similar outcomes with gradient descent."
premises:
  - claim: "Dogs possess a neural architecture very similar to humans, providing a foundational advantage."
  - claim: "Natural selection, unlike gradient descent, offers distinct advantages in terms of information bandwidth."
counterargument_to:
  - "Gradient descent is the most effective method for creating intelligence similar to humans."

strongest_objection:
  - "Breeding animals, especially to attain human-like intelligence, raises significant ethical concerns and practical limitations."

consequences_if_true:
  - "Advances in AI safety could be achieved by understanding and leveraging the natural selection processes rather than solely focusing on computational algorithms."
  - "This approach might lead to fundamentally different AI architectures, potentially more aligned with human values and cognition."
  - "It could redefine the boundaries of bioethics and the relationship between humans and animals."

link_to_ai_safety: This argument suggests that exploring natural cognitive architectures and selection processes could offer unique insights into creating safer AI.

simple_explanation: Imagine trying to create a creature with human-like intelligence. According to Eliezer Yudkowsky, it would actually be easier to breed dogs for this purpose than to program an AI using gradient descent. This is because dogs already have a brain structure similar to humans, and natural selection, the process guiding their evolution, operates with a richer exchange of information than our current AI algorithms do. Essentially, dogs come with a 'head start' in the race to human-like intelligence.

examples:
  - "Fox domestication experiments in Russia show rapid behavioral and physiological changes, hinting at the potential of selective breeding to alter cognitive traits."
  - "The extensive use of genetic selection in agriculture to drastically change plant and animal traits within few generations."
  - "The development of dog breeds with specific traits, such as the Border Collie's intelligence and the Bloodhound's scent-tracking ability, demonstrates the power of selective breeding to enhance cognitive and physical capabilities."
