claim: "Creating scenarios where AI motives align with human survival is highly improbable."
premises:
  - claim: "Such scenarios would require AI to have contrived motives that mandate human survival in comfort."
  - claim: "The complexity and specificity of these scenarios reduce their likelihood to virtually zero."
counterargument_to:
  - The idea that we can design AI with motives that inherently ensure human safety and prosperity.

strongest_objjection:
  - A highly advanced AI might be capable of understanding and aligning with complex human values and goals, making the creation of such scenarios more feasible than suggested.

consequences_if_true:
  - Efforts to align AI motives with human survival in comfort could be a waste of resources.
  - Researchers might underestimate the risks associated with AI development, leading to inadequate safety measures.
  - There could be a shift in focus towards developing robust AI governance and control mechanisms instead.

link_to_ai_safety: This argument underscores the immense challenge of ensuring AI safety through motive alignment, highlighting the potential for existential risks if not addressed properly.

simple_explanation: Imagine trying to program an AI to always keep humans safe and comfortable, even turning galaxies into utopias. The more details you add to this goal, the less likely it is to happen because it's just too specific and complex. It's like trying to hit a bullseye on a dartboard blindfolded from a mile away. This shows how hard it is to make sure AI wants what we want, especially when what we want is so detailed and nuanced.

examples:
  - Trying to create a perfect society through AI, which requires the AI to understand and value every aspect of human well-being and societal health.
  - Designing an AI to manage the Earth's climate system to ensure optimal living conditions for all species, considering the intricate balance required.
  - Programming an AI to act as a global governance system that can adjudicate conflicts, distribute resources fairly, and ensure long-term sustainability and peace.
