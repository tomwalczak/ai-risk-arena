claim: "Simulating the evolution of AGI through the development from non-people to people entails suffering and is ethically wrong."
premises:
  - claim: "Simulating evolution involves a transition from non-person entities to persons, raising ethical concerns."
  - claim: "The necessity for hardware evolution for meme transmission before achieving personhood implies inherent suffering."
counterargument_to:
  - "Simulating AGI evolution is a methodical and morally neutral approach to understanding and developing artificial general intelligence."
  - "The suffering of simulated entities, if they are not recognized as persons, does not carry ethical implications."

strongest_objection:
  - "If simulated entities do not possess consciousness or the ability to experience suffering in a manner analogous to humans or animals, the ethical concerns might not apply as traditional ethics presupposes sentience."

consequences_if_true:
  - If true, this argument would necessitate the imposition of ethical guidelines specific to the simulation of evolutionary processes in AGI development.
  - It would challenge developers and researchers to find alternative methods of AGI development that do not entail the simulation of suffering.
  - It might slow down the progress in AGI research due to the additional ethical considerations and constraints.

link_to_ai_safety: This argument emphasizes the ethical dimensions of AI safety, particularly concerning the potential for suffering in simulated evolutionary processes.

simple_explanation: Simulating the evolution of AGI, from entities that are not people to those that are, implies a phase where these entities might undergo suffering. This process raises significant ethical concerns because it mirrors the evolution of consciousness and suffering in humans and animals. If we believe in minimizing suffering and treating entities with personhood ethically, then simulating such an evolution without considering these aspects would be morally wrong. It challenges us to consider the rights and well-being of entities that might not yet exist but could, through our actions, come to experience suffering.

examples:
  - The historical development of human intelligence and society involved significant suffering; replicating this process digitally may perpetuate ethical issues.
  - In popular media, stories like "Westworld" explore the ethical implications of creating sentient beings capable of suffering for entertainment or research.
  - The philosophical thought experiment of Robert Nozick's "Experience Machine" suggests complexities in simulating realities that are preferable to actual life, highlighting the ethical dilemmas in distinguishing real from simulated suffering.
