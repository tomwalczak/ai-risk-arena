claim: "AGI is qualitatively different from other computer programs and cannot emerge from complexity or increased computer power alone."
premises:
  - claim: "The misconception that AGI might emerge from complexity or increased power is flawed."
  - claim: "Expecting AGI to emerge without understanding its workings is unrealistic."
counterargument_to:
  - AGI can emerge from simply increasing computational power or complexity.
  - AGI development is a quantitative scale-up of current computing capabilities.
  - Existing approaches to AI programming will eventually lead to AGI as a side effect.

strongest_objection:
  - If computational power and complexity have led to significant advancements in AI, why wouldn't they eventually lead to AGI?

consequences_if_true:
  - A fundamental shift in how we approach AGI development would be required, focusing on philosophical and epistemological breakthroughs.
  - Many current research efforts and resources might be misdirected, necessitating a realignment towards understanding the nature of human cognition and knowledge creation.
  - The timeline to achieving AGI could be significantly different from current predictions, potentially either much longer or shorter depending on breakthroughs in understanding cognition.

link_to_ai_safety: Understanding the qualitative difference between AGI and other computer programs is essential for developing safe and beneficial AGI.

simple_explanation: AGI is not something that can simply emerge from making computers more powerful or complex. It requires a breakthrough in our understanding of how knowledge is created and processed, something current approaches do not adequately address. This means we can't just scale up what we're doing; we need a fundamentally new direction that considers the philosophical underpinnings of intelligence itself. Assuming we can stumble into AGI through more power or complexity underestimates the challenge and risks misdirecting valuable resources.

examples:
  - No matter how much you upgrade a calculator's speed or complexity, it won't start understanding the problems it solves or develop insights about mathematics.
  - Improving a car's engine to make it faster doesn't suddenly turn it into a plane; a qualitative leap in design and functionality is required.
  - Increasing the resolution and processing power of a camera doesn't give it the ability to interpret and understand the images it captures.
