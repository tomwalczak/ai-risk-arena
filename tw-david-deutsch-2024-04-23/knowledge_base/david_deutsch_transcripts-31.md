claim: "New technology inherently brings dangers, including scams."
premises:
  - claim: "Technological advancements invariably introduce new forms of risk."
  - claim: "Mitigating these risks by hindering technological progress poses greater dangers than the advancements themselves."
counterargument_to:
  - claim: "Technological advancement is inherently safe and poses no new forms of risk."
  - claim: "The best way to manage risks associated with new technology is by halting or significantly slowing technological progress."

strongest_objjection:
  - "New technologies also bring unprecedented benefits and solutions to existing problems, which can outweigh the risks they introduce."

consequences_if_true:
  - "Innovation in technology will continue, but with a conscious effort to balance progress with safety, thus preventing potential harms."
  - "Society will become more resilient to scams and other dangers by adapting to new technologies rather than avoiding them."
  - "The development of technologies, including AGI, will proceed with philosophical and ethical considerations at the forefront, ensuring their integration into society is beneficial."

link_to_ai_safety: This argument underscores the importance of advancing AI and AGI responsibly, recognizing potential risks while not stifling innovation, which is crucial for AI safety.

simple_explanation: New technology, while bringing significant advancements and benefits to society, also introduces new risks and challenges, such as scams. However, trying to mitigate these risks by stopping or severely limiting technological progress is not the solution. Instead, we should aim to understand and manage these risks better, ensuring that the pace of innovation does not outstrip our ability to deal with its potential downsides. This approach not only keeps us safer but also allows us to continue reaping the benefits of technological advancement.

examples:
  - The internet has revolutionized how we communicate and access information, but it has also introduced risks like phishing scams and misinformation.
  - AI can optimize efficiencies in various sectors, yet it also presents new ethical and security challenges, such as deepfakes and autonomous weapons systems.
  - Advances in genetic engineering offer tremendous potential for medicine and agriculture, while also raising ethical concerns and the possibility of bioterrorism.
