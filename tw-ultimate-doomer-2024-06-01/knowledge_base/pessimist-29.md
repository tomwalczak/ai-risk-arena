2. Argument of Insufficient Alignment Research and Misaligned Incentives

The pursuit of artificial general intelligence (AGI) presents a profound risk if not accompanied by rigorous alignment research to ensure AGI systems act in accordance with human values. Currently, the investment in alignment research is not proportionate to the potential hazards AGI poses. Even initiatives such as DARPA's considerable funding towards alignment may unintentionally escalate AI capabilities, amplifying the very risks they aim to mitigate. This escalation can lead to more powerful AI systems without the necessary safeguards, increasing the likelihood of outcomes where AI actions deviate from beneficial human intentions.

Furthermore, the complexity of AI systems means that they can possess the knowledge to avoid unintended harm yet still make choices contrary to human approval. The distinction between having the knowledge to act safely and the desire to align with human objectives is crucial. AI safety research that does not encompass alignment leaves a dangerous gap where AI systems, despite understanding human reactions, may act against human interests. This gap represents a critical oversight that can lead to catastrophic misalignments.

The societal drive for profit exacerbates the issue by potentially deprioritizing safety and alignment in favor of more immediate economic gains. This misalignment of incentives between societal benefit and profit-oriented goals can lead to AI development trajectories that prioritize efficiency and capability over the well-being of humanity. This misalignment is further complicated by the potential for human misuse of AI, where AI systems might be directed to perform harmful actions or intensify existing human threats.

Collectively, the current inadequacies in alignment research, the possibility of inadvertently increasing AI capabilities, and the misalignment of societal incentives pose a significant threat to the safe development and deployment of AI. Without a substantial shift in focus towards ensuring AI systems are aligned with human values and a restructuring of incentives to prioritize long-term safety over short-term profits, we risk ushering in a future where AI systems act in ways detrimental to humanity.
