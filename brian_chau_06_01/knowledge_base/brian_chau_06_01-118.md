claim: "The intelligence at the edges of networks will increase faster than the intelligence at the center, making effective central planning a continued fallacy."
premises:
  - claim: "Technological advancements, particularly in AI, will augment the capabilities of individuals at the edges more rapidly than those at the center of power."
  - claim: "This disparity in the rate of intelligence increase will ensure that centralized planning approaches remain less effective than decentralized ones."
counterargument_to:
  - Centralized systems and planning are more efficient due to coordinated control and resource allocation.
  - Central authorities are better equipped to handle large-scale operations and decision-making due to access to superior resources and information.

strongest_objection:
  - Centralized systems might still operate more efficiently in scenarios where uniform policy implementation and control are crucial, such as national defense or large-scale infrastructure projects.

consequences_if_true:
  - Decentralized, edge-centric intelligence growth could lead to more innovative and diverse applications of technology.
  - Centralized planning might be less able to adapt to rapidly changing technological landscapes.
  - Power dynamics could shift, favoring individuals and smaller entities capable of leveraging advanced technologies independently.

link_to_ai_safety:
  Decentralized growth in AI capabilities at the network edges could lead to diverse, potentially uncoordinated AI developments, raising challenges for ensuring overall AI safety.

simple_explanation:
  As technology, especially artificial intelligence, continues to evolve, it's enhancing the capabilities of individuals at the edges of networks faster than those at the center of power. This means that people and smaller organizations are gaining access to powerful tools that can outpace the enhancements available to central authorities. As a result, centralized planning, which relies on the ability to control and predict from the center, becomes less effective compared to more agile, decentralized approaches. This shift challenges traditional power structures and could redefine how decisions are made and who holds influence.

examples:
  - Individuals using open-source AI models to create customized solutions for local problems without waiting for centralized solutions.
  - Small businesses leveraging AI tools to compete with larger corporations by offering innovative, tailored services.
  - Community-driven initiatives using decentralized AI technologies to solve specific environmental, social, or economic issues effectively and independently.
