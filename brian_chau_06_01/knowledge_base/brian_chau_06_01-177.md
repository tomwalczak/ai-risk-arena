link_to_ai_safety:
  The increasing presence of AI bots in social interactions raises concerns about privacy, manipulation, and the integrity of human communication.

simple_explanation:
  Imagine logging onto your favorite social network and most of your interactions are with AI bots that are indistinguishable from humans. These bots could engage you in conversations, offer advice, or even provide companionship. As AI technology evolves, these 'artificial people' could become a mainstay in our digital lives. Users might find these interactions preferable due to consistency, availability, and perhaps even the ability to tailor conversations to individual preferences.

examples:
  - Chatbots on platforms like Twitter or Facebook that automatically generate engaging and relevant content for users.
  - AI companions in virtual reality platforms that provide interactive and personalized social experiences.
  - Customer service bots on social networks that handle inquiries and provide instant responses around the clock.
