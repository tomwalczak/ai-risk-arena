link_to_ai_safety: Understanding mass support for AI can help tailor AI safety measures that are publicly acceptable and supported, enhancing overall trust and cooperation.

simple_explanation:
  The pro AI movement is gaining traction not through loud advocacy but via the quiet endorsement of everyday users. As millions incorporate AI tools into their daily lives, whether for work, education, or entertainment, they are, perhaps unknowingly, participating in a grassroots movement that supports AI development. This widespread, though implicit, engagement suggests a robust, bottom-up support for AI, contrasting with the vocal minority opposing it. The absence of a distinct leadership or vanguard further indicates that this support is organic and widespread, rather than orchestrated by a few.

examples:
  - The ubiquitous use of AI-driven platforms like Google, Amazon, and Netflix where AI enhances user experience.
  - The rapid adoption of AI personal assistants like Siri and Alexa in homes worldwide.
  - Increasing reliance on AI for educational purposes, such as tutoring systems and personalized learning platforms.
