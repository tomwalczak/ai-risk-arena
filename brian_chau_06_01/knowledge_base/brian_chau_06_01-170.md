claim: "AI will enable highly intelligent individuals to achieve significantly more."
premises:
  - claim: "Individuals with high IQs will have access to AI tools that exponentially increase their productivity and capabilities."
  - claim: "These enhanced capabilities will allow high IQ individuals to perform complex tasks more efficiently, equivalent to having many more people working for them."
counterargument_to:
  - "AI will level the playing field among individuals of varying intelligence levels."
  - "AI will democratize access to information and capabilities, reducing the gap between the highly intelligent and the average individual."

strongest_objection:
  - "AI tools might widen the gap between the highly intelligent and others by providing disproportionate advantages to those who can already leverage their intellectual capabilities more effectively."

consequences_if_true:
  - High IQ individuals will dominate key sectors and innovation, possibly increasing societal stratification.
  - There might be an exponential increase in productivity and breakthroughs in fields dominated by high IQ individuals.
  - Could lead to increased disparities in wealth and power if safeguards are not in place.

link_to_ai_safety:
  - This argument links to AI safety by highlighting the potential for AI to exacerbate inequalities, which could lead to social unrest and destabilization.

simple_explanation:
  AI is much like a multiplier. For individuals with high intelligence, AI tools act as force multipliers, enhancing their ability to perform tasks and solve problems at scale. Imagine giving a very skilled carpenter advanced machinery; not only does their productivity increase, but the quality and complexity of what they can create does too. Similarly, high IQ individuals with access to AI can achieve more than ever before, pushing the boundaries of what is possible in their fields.

examples:
  - A leading scientist using AI to simulate and solve complex biological problems thousands of times faster than possible before.
  - A top engineer using AI tools to design more efficient, safer, and sustainable buildings and infrastructure.
  - Financial analysts using AI to process large datasets for market predictions with unprecedented accuracy and speed.
