claim: "The broad classification of dual-use technologies is problematic."
premises:
  - claim: "Technologies such as large language models are being labeled as military adjacent."
  - claim: "This broad classification can be extended to virtually all technology, including everyday items like computers and plastics that are also used in warfare."
counterargument_to:
  - The argument that dual-use technology should be tightly regulated due to its potential military applications.

strongest_objection:
  - Dual-use classifications are necessary to monitor and control technologies that could be easily converted for harmful uses, enhancing national and global security.

consequences_if_true:
  - It would challenge the effectiveness of current security measures and policies aimed at controlling dual-use technologies.
  - It could lead to overly broad restrictions that stifle innovation and technological progress.
  - It might result in a misunderstanding of the true nature and potential of technologies, leading to misplaced fears and regulations.

link_to_ai_safety:
  - Understanding the broad implications of labeling technologies as dual-use is crucial for developing balanced AI safety and governance frameworks.

simple_explanation:
  Labeling technologies as dual-use because they can be used in military settings, such as large language models or computers, is problematic. This approach could theoretically extend to almost any technology, leading to unnecessary restrictions and stifling innovation. It's important to focus on the specific applications rather than the technology itself, to avoid broad and often unproductive limitations that do not accurately reflect the technology’s primary use or potential.

examples:
  - Computers and the internet, which are used in both civilian and military contexts, but are primarily tools for information and communication.
  - GPS technology, originally military but now crucial for civilian navigation and various other applications.
  - Plastics, used widely in consumer products and healthcare, yet also in various military applications.
