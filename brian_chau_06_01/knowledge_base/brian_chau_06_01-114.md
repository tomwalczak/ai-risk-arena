claim: "The resistance to new technology follows a three-stage framework."
premises:
  - claim: "The first stage of resistance to new technology is ignoring its existence."
  - claim: "The second stage involves rational counterarguments by existing experts to discredit the new technology."
  - claim: "The third stage is characterized by name-calling and intense opposition."
counterargument_to:
  - "New technologies are seamlessly integrated and welcomed without resistance."
  - "Technological adoption is solely based on the utility and effectiveness of the technology itself, without influence from social, political, or personal biases."

strongest_objection:
  - "Resistance to new technologies is not universally staged as described; in some cases, adoption can be swift and unopposed if the technology aligns well with existing values and needs."

consequences_if_true:
  - "Understanding this framework helps predict and manage the adoption process of new technologies, potentially smoothing transitions and reducing conflicts."
  - "Identifying these stages could be used to manipulate public perception and artificially accelerate or decelerate technology acceptance."
  - "Awareness of this pattern may lead to strategic innovations in policy-making, corporate strategy, and public relations to address each stage effectively."

link_to_ai_safety:
  - "Recognizing these stages of resistance can inform strategies to ensure AI technologies are integrated in society in a safe, ethical, and accepted manner."

simple_explanation:
  - "According to Marc Andreesen, resistance to new technologies that could shift power dynamics undergoes a predictable three-stage process. Initially, these technologies are ignored; they're treated as non-existent or irrelevant. If they gain some traction, established experts then deploy rational counterarguments to challenge their viability or safety. Finally, if the technology still persists, the resistance turns to intense opposition, often involving personal attacks or fear-mongering. Understanding this pattern can help innovators and policymakers better navigate the complex social dynamics that influence technological adoption."

examples:
  - "The adoption of the automatic naval gun, which faced decades of resistance from traditional naval structures until intervention by President Roosevelt."
  - "The initial resistance to the introduction of the printing press, which was opposed by established institutions like the Catholic Church fearing loss of information control."
  - "The slow acceptance and intense debate surrounding the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in agriculture, opposed by both environmental groups and traditional farmers."
