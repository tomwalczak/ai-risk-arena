  Ensuring AI leads to job creation and higher wages is crucial for societal acceptance and the ethical deployment of AI technologies.

simple_explanation:
  Historically, technological advancements, like the Industrial Revolution and the rise of the internet, have created more jobs than they've destroyed and have generally led to higher wages. Artificial Intelligence, as a powerful tool for enhancing productivity, is likely to continue this trend. It's not just about replacing jobs but transforming them and creating new opportunities in emerging sectors. Therefore, embracing AI could lead to a more prosperous and innovative future.

examples:
  - The Industrial Revolution, which automated many manual tasks but created jobs in new manufacturing industries.
  - The rise of personal computing, which led to the creation of entirely new fields in software and hardware development.
  - The introduction of ATMs, which automated certain banking tasks but led to an increase in the number of bank branches and services offered, thus creating more jobs.
