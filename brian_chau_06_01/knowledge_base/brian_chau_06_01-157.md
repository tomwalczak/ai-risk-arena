link_to_ai_safety:
  - Understanding varied perceptions of new technologies by age can guide safer, more inclusive AI development and deployment strategies.

simple_explanation:
  - People of different ages see new technologies in distinct ways. Kids under 15 often view these technologies as a normal part of their world. Young adults, from 15 to 35, tend to see them as exciting and full of career opportunities. However, those over 35 might find the same technologies disruptive or even threatening. This variation impacts how technologies should be introduced and discussed across generations.

examples:
  - Children growing up with voice-assisted devices like Alexa or Siri perceive these as everyday tools, unlike older generations who may view them with skepticism.
  - Young professionals might pursue careers in emerging fields like blockchain or renewable energies, which they see as innovative, whereas older individuals might view these as complex and risky.
  - Older adults might be more resistant to autonomous vehicles, seeing them as unsafe, compared to younger adults who appreciate the convenience and the innovation behind them.
