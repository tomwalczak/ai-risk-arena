consequences_if_true:
  - "If large AI companies advocate for regulations primarily to maintain market dominance, this could stifle innovation by raising barriers for new entrants."
  - "Such a strategy could lead to a monopolistic market structure, reducing competition and potentially slowing the pace of technological advancement."

link_to_ai_safety:
  - The argument impacts AI safety by suggesting that market dynamics, influenced by regulatory capture, could prioritize corporate interests over genuine safety advancements.

simple_explanation:
  - When big AI companies push for regulations, it might seem like they’re prioritizing safety. However, these regulations could also serve to protect these companies from competition by making it harder for newer, smaller companies to enter the market. This can keep the big companies in control, potentially at the expense of innovation and fair pricing.

examples:
  - Implementation of high-cost compliance measures that only financially robust companies can afford.
  - Lobbying for complex licensing requirements that are cumbersome for startups but manageable for large companies.
  - Supporting international standards that align with the technologies and methodologies predominantly used by these large companies, sidelining alternative approaches.
