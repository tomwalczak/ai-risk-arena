simple_explanation:
  - Technological advancements such as podcasts and the internet have broken down barriers that traditionally limited access to deep intellectual content to a select few. Now, anyone with internet access can explore complex ideas, listen to expert discussions, and participate in intellectual debates, not just those within academic circles. This democratization means that we're seeing more diverse voices and ideas in intellectual discourse, enriching it and making it more representative of society as a whole. This expansion is not just about quantity; it's about enhancing the quality of public discourse and making it more inclusive.

  - Educational podcasts like "Philosophize This!" or "The History of Philosophy Without Any Gaps" that provide university-level content for free.
  - Platforms like Coursera and Khan Academy that offer courses from institutions like Stanford and MIT at no cost.
  - Online forums and social media platforms where people engage in discussions and debates about complex subjects such as philosophy, science, and technology.
