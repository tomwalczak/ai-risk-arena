claim: "AI will exacerbate economic inequalities by disproportionately benefiting those with higher IQs."
premises:
  - claim: "AI will significantly enhance the capabilities of individuals with an IQ of 140, giving them a disproportionate advantage."
  - claim: "This enhancement will lead to greater power and wealth accumulation for high IQ individuals at the expense of those with lower IQs."
counterargument_to:
  - AI will democratize access to intelligence, thereby reducing economic inequalities.
  - AI as an augmentation tool will benefit everyone equally, leveling the playing field across different IQ levels.

strongest_objection:
  - AI tools might be universally accessible, but the capacity to leverage these tools effectively could still depend heavily on individual cognitive abilities and educational backgrounds, thus not fully neutralizing the initial disparities.

consequences_if_true:
  - Individuals with higher IQs could accelerate their own advancement, utilizing AI to increase their productivity and problem-solving capabilities significantly more than those with lower IQs.
  - This could lead to a concentration of wealth and influence in a small segment of the population, potentially leading to greater societal stratification and unrest.
  - Economic policies might need restructuring to address these new forms of inequality, such as through revised taxation, wealth redistribution, or educational reforms.

link_to_ai_safety:
  Ensuring AI safety includes considering how its distribution and effects can be equitable to prevent new forms of inequality.

simple_explanation:
  If AI drastically enhances the capabilities of those with high IQs more than those with lower IQs, it could deepen economic inequalities. High IQ individuals might use AI to pull further ahead in wealth and influence, leveraging these tools to maximize their advantages. This could concentrate power and economic resources, potentially sidelining others in society who might not harness AI as effectively, thus exacerbating existing disparities.

examples:
  - A high IQ software developer uses AI to create advanced algorithms that optimize financial trading, earning substantial profits while less tech-savvy individuals lack the skills to compete.
  - An executive uses AI-driven analytics to make strategic decisions that outpace competitors who do not integrate AI as effectively, leading to significant market share gains.
  - A researcher with access to AI accelerates scientific discoveries, securing patents and forming startups, thereby accumulating wealth and resources at a pace unmatchable by peers with lower cognitive abilities or less AI fluency.
