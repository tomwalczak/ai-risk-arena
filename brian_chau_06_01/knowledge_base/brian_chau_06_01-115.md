claim: "Rational arguments against new technologies are often flawed and influenced by the endowment effect."
premises:
  - claim: "Experts making rational arguments are often those with vested interests and credentials."
  - claim: "These arguments depend heavily on the assumptions these experts bring to the table."
  - claim: "Smart people are good at creating complex theories and rationalizing disconfirming evidence to support their views."
counterargument_to:
  - The argument that new technologies should be embraced without skepticism.
  - The belief that experts always provide objective, unbiased recommendations on new technologies.

strongest_objection:
  - Experts might offer critical insights that are valid and not merely influenced by self-interest or the endowment effect.
  - Technological skepticism could serve as a necessary check against untested, potentially harmful innovations.

consequences_if_true:
  - Experts' resistance to new technologies could delay or prevent beneficial innovations.
  - Public trust in professional expertise could be undermined.
  - Misguided resistance could lead to missed opportunities and competitive disadvantages.

link_to_ai_safety:
  - Understanding biases in expert arguments against AI can help in designing safer AI systems by ensuring a diversity of perspectives.

simple_explanation:
  Rational arguments against new technologies, while seemingly sound, can often be deeply flawed due to the endowment effect, where experts cling to familiar technologies and resist change that threatens their status or understanding. These experts are skilled in constructing sophisticated theories that support their views, often dismissing contradictory evidence. This phenomenon can lead to significant delays in adopting beneficial technologies, as seen in historical cases like the naval gun improvement resisted by traditional naval officers.

examples:
  - Naval officers resisting the introduction of a more accurate gunnery system due to it rendering their skills and authority obsolete.
  - Public health experts during the COVID pandemic possibly being influenced by their pre-existing professional paradigms.
  - Resistance in the AI field where established experts may dismiss newer AI technologies or methods that challenge the conventional wisdom.
