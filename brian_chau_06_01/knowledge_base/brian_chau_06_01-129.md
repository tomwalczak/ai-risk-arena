claim: "Social support for AI is fickle."
premises:
  - claim: "People may state in polls that they oppose AI but show no willingness to demonstrate this belief through actions like attending rallies or discontinuing AI usage."
  - claim: "The discrepancy between stated opposition in polls and actual behavior indicates that the opposition to AI is more about social conformity than genuine belief."
counterargument_to:
  - The argument that widespread public opposition to AI, as shown in opinion polls, reflects a deep and genuine societal concern about AI technologies.

strongest_objection:
  - People might genuinely dislike AI but lack the time, resources, or energy to actively participate in anti-AI activities, leading to a discrepancy between poll responses and visible action.

consequences_if_true:
  - If public opposition to AI is superficial, this might lead to unstable regulatory environments as policies could shift rapidly with changing public opinion.
  - It could undermine efforts to address legitimate concerns about AI if these concerns are dismissed as mere social conformity.
  - Misinterpretation of public sentiment could lead to overinvestment in unpopular technologies, risking backlash and financial losses.

link_to_ai_safety:
  - Understanding the genuine level of public support for or opposition to AI is crucial for developing effective and widely accepted AI safety measures.

simple_explanation:
  The claim that social support for AI is fickle suggests that while many people might express a dislike for AI in opinion polls, this opposition does not often translate into tangible actions, such as participating in protests or stopping the use of AI technologies. This discrepancy could indicate that people's stated views are more about fitting in with perceived societal norms than about their actual beliefs. If true, this implies that opinions on AI could quickly change, making it difficult to predict or build stable, long-term strategies for AI governance or development.

examples:
  - Opinion polls showing high opposition to AI, but continued widespread use of AI applications like smartphones and social media platforms.
  - Low turnout at rallies or other public demonstrations against AI, despite significant expressed concerns in surveys.
  - The rapid shift in public concerns from one technology to another, as seen in the transfer of focus from crypto to AI, suggesting a trend-driven rather than a deeply-rooted opposition.
