  - This argument underscores the importance of balanced narratives in shaping policies that affect AI safety and development.

simple_explanation: 
  - The main claim here is that the predominant voices in AI policy within Washington D.C. have been heavily influenced by organizations that invest large amounts of money to promote a fear-based view of AI.
