claim: "AI will significantly enhance the capabilities of individuals with lower IQs."
premises:
  - claim: "AI acts as an augmentation, similar to eyeglasses for eyes or cars for speed."
  - claim: "Such augmentation allows individuals with lower IQs to pair with AI, effectively boosting their intelligence."
counteragument_to:
  - "AI will exacerbate inequalities by disproportionately benefiting those with higher IQs, leaving those with lower IQs further disadvantaged."
  - "AI's complexity and sophistication might only be fully harnessed by those who are already intellectually equipped, thus widening the cognitive and socio-economic divides."

strongest_objection:
  - "AI might not be able to fully compensate for the cognitive limitations of individuals with lower IQs, as interacting effectively with AI itself requires a certain level of cognitive skills."
  - "The real-world application and accessibility of AI might be limited by socio-economic factors, restricting the benefits to those who are already privileged."

consequences_if_true:
  - Enhanced cognitive tools will democratize intelligence, allowing individuals with lower IQs to perform tasks they were previously unable to handle.
  - This democratization could lead to a reduction in economic disparities caused by educational and intellectual inequalities.
  - Society might experience a shift in how intelligence is valued, with traditional measures of IQ becoming less relevant in determining an individual's potential and productivity.

link_to_ai_safety:
  Ensuring AI augments intelligence equitably across different IQ levels is crucial for AI safety and societal harmony.

simple_explanation:
  Think of AI as a tool that boosts a person's intellectual capabilities much like how glasses improve vision. Just as glasses help people with poor eyesight to see clearly, AI can help those with lower IQs to enhance their cognitive abilities. This means that tasks which require higher levels of intelligence can become accessible to more people, potentially leveling the playing field in many professional and everyday scenarios. Essentially, AI could serve as a great equalizer in the cognitive domain, much like how the internet provided vast information access to the masses.

examples:
  - A person with a lower IQ might use an AI-powered tutoring system to understand complex scientific concepts or solve mathematical problems, enhancing their learning and comprehension.
  - AI-driven decision-making tools could assist individuals in making better financial decisions, improving their economic status and quality of life.
  - AI applications in job training could provide personalized learning paths that adapt to the cognitive levels of users, making higher-skilled jobs accessible to a broader range of people.
