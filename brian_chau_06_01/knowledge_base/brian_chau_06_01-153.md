simple_explanation:
  - Speculative bubbles in technology, despite their risks, bring a massive influx of money and expertise into sectors where they occur. This large-scale investment is crucial as it provides the necessary resources to refine and advance new technologies, which might otherwise struggle to get off the ground. Think of it as an intense, if somewhat chaotic, boost that can propel a promising technology into practical and widespread application. Without this, many innovative ideas might never reach their potential or find practical application.

examples:
  - The dot-com bubble in the late 1990s to early 2000s which, despite many failures, also led to the success of major companies like Amazon and Google.
  - The cryptocurrency boom which has funded extensive blockchain technology research and development.
  - The AI hype in various decades that increased funding and interest in AI research, contributing to advancements in machine learning and data processing technologies.
