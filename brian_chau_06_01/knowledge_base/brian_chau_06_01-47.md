claim: "Addressing risks associated with AI and biosecurity effectively involves making the action problem more challenging."
premises:
  - claim: "The main challenge in preventing bioterrorism is not the acquisition of knowledge but the difficulty of actions such as synthesizing a virus."
  - claim: "Increasing the difficulty of these actions is a more effective strategy than restricting knowledge access."
counterargument_to:
  - The claim that restricting access to knowledge is the best way to prevent bioterrorism and other risks associated with AI and biosecurity.

strongest_objection:
  - Increasing the difficulty of actions might slow down legitimate scientific and technological progress, potentially hindering beneficial developments in biotechnology and AI.

consequences_if_true:
  - It would become harder for malicious actors to misuse biotechnology and AI for harmful purposes.
  - Legitimate researchers and developers might face greater barriers to innovation, possibly slowing scientific advancement.
  - Policy and regulation could shift focus from knowledge restriction to enhancing security measures around practical applications.

link_to_ai_safety:
  This approach emphasizes the importance of focusing on the practical aspects of AI implementation to ensure safety and security, aligning with broader goals of AI safety.

simple_explanation:
  Addressing the risks associated with AI and biosecurity by making the action problem more challenging means focusing on the practical difficulties rather than just limiting knowledge. For instance, even if someone can easily find information on how to synthesize a virus, actually doing so requires specific skills, materials, and equipment. By increasing these practical challenges, we can prevent misuse without stifling the free flow of scientific knowledge. This approach balances safety with the progression of beneficial technology.

examples:
  - Synthesizing a virus is much harder than accessing its genomic sequence online, illustrating the difference between knowing how to do something and being able to do it.
  - Regulations that control access to specific chemicals and laboratory equipment used in potentially dangerous research without restricting academic or scientific discourse.
  - The implementation of advanced cybersecurity measures to prevent unauthorized use of AI systems without limiting the development and sharing of AI technologies.
