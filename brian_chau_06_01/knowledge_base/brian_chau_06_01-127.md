claim: "The AI Doomer movement lacks mass support."
premises:
  - claim: "The total number of people attending anti-AI rallies during work hours is zero."
  - claim: "100 million people are already using AI productively and happily in their daily lives, which shows a lack of support for the AI Doomer movement."
counterargument_to:
  - The AI Doomer movement has significant support and influence within society.

strongest_objection:
  - The premise that zero attendees at anti-AI rallies during work hours indicates a lack of mass support could be misleading, as it ignores other forms of protest and dissent that do not involve physical rallies, such as digital activism or written and spoken advocacy against AI.

consequences_if_true:
  - If the AI Doomer movement truly lacks mass support, its influence on public policy and technological development could be minimal.
  - The development and integration of AI technologies might proceed with less public resistance and more rapid acceptance.
  - Companies and developers might face fewer ethical and regulatory hurdles, potentially accelerating the pace of AI innovation.

link_to_ai_safety:
  - Understanding the level of support for the AI Doomer movement is crucial for shaping the strategies around AI safety and regulation.

simple_explanation:
  The argument suggests that the AI Doomer movement does not have widespread backing among the general population. This is evidenced by the absence of people attending anti-AI rallies during work hours and by the substantial number of people, 100 million, who use AI technologies contentedly in their everyday lives. If few are willing to publicly protest and many more actively engage with AI, it implies that the movement against AI does not resonate with the majority.

examples:
  - No participants at organized anti-AI events during peak hours, indicating possible apathy or disagreement with the movement's views.
  - High adoption rates of AI-driven tools like virtual assistants, recommendation systems, and automated customer service solutions show general public approval and reliance on AI.
  - The contrast in proactive engagement between those opposing AI and those using AI technologies daily, with the latter group vastly outnumbering the former.
