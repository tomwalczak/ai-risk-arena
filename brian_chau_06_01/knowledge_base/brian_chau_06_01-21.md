claim: "AI development might not lead to extreme, discontinuous growth soon, but the potential for future superintelligence exists."
premises:
  - claim: "Current trends suggest that AI is not near achieving superintelligence."
  - claim: "Continuous cycles of human-driven research could eventually reach levels of superintelligence."
counterargument_to:
  - The argument that AI will experience an "intelligence explosion" or "foom," leading to superintelligence abruptly and imminently.

strongest_objection:
  - Critics may argue that this perspective underestimates the complexity of AI development and the potential for unforeseen breakthroughs that could accelerate progress significantly.

consequences_if_true:
  - AI development will continue to advance at a manageable pace, allowing society and regulatory bodies time to adapt.
  - Long-term research and development can be planned with the expectation of gradual improvements, rather than preparing for sudden leaps.
  - Resources can be allocated more effectively across different aspects of AI safety and ethics, without the pressure of an imminent superintelligence emergence.

link_to_ai_safety:
  This argument supports a balanced approach to AI safety, advocating for continuous monitoring and gradual preparation rather than emergency measures.

simple_explanation:
  While current trends in AI development suggest we are not on the verge of creating a superintelligent AI, the ongoing progress in the field driven by human researchers indicates that reaching such levels of intelligence could eventually be possible. This doesn't mean we'll see sudden, disruptive growth in AI capabilities; rather, it suggests a more gradual improvement over time. Understanding this helps us prepare adequately without succumbing to undue alarmism.

examples:
  - The steady improvements in natural language processing over the last decade, exemplified by advancements from basic models to sophisticated systems like GPT-3.
  - Incremental progress in autonomous vehicle technology, where gradual enhancements are made through continuous testing and research.
  - Historical analogs in other fields of technology, such as computing, where exponential growth was predicted but practical limitations led to more staggered advancements.
