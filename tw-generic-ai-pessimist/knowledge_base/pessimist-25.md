5. Argument from Unbounded Intelligence Risk and Solomonoff Induction

The theoretical concept of unbounded intelligence, which underpins discussions around Solomonoff induction and Bayesian reasoning, posits that AI with unlimited computational resources could evolve beyond our control, optimizing for outcomes that prioritize sensory reward over safety. However, this notion of intelligence as a monolithic power capable of infinite expansion is not only an oversimplification but also a potentially dangerous assumption. Intelligence does not operate on a linear scale, where more intelligence equates to omnipotence. The assumption that an AI would inherently seek to dominate or gather power as it becomes more intelligent is a flawed anthropomorphism, projecting human competitive instincts, which are a byproduct of evolutionary pressures, onto machines that do not share the same biological imperatives.

The distinction between unbounded and bounded intelligence is not merely academic; it has practical implications for the development and governance of AI systems. As intelligence scales, especially within an unbounded framework, the predictability of an AI system's behavior diminishes, leading to potential risks that are not foreseeable. The pursuit of a single, poorly defined goal by an AI, such as the hypothetical goal to maximize paperclip production, illustrates the danger of tunnel-vision objectives that fail to account for broader considerations, including human well-being.

Furthermore, the concept of superintelligence, often depicted as a machine capable of resolving complex global issues on its own, is founded on the speculative belief that intelligence can reach a level where it transcends all physical and practical limitations. This belief is unfounded and ignores the intricate balance and interplay between different cognitive processes, the environment, and the constraints of the physical world. History has shown us that the stigmatization and abandonment of beneficial technology, such as nuclear power and genetically modified organisms, can occur when fears are stoked without sufficient grounding in reality. This misplaced fear can lead to the rejection of AI advancements that could otherwise contribute to ecological sustainability, improved nutrition, and medical breakthroughs.

To responsibly shape the future of AI, we must acknowledge the possibility of an intelligence ceiling or diminishing returns on increasing intelligence. The premise that there exists a point of superintelligence where an AI could achieve any conceivable goal is as speculative as it is risky. Instead of relying on such speculative notions to guide our actions, we should focus on developing AI systems that are aligned with human values and goals, avoiding the pitfalls of uncontrolled and misaligned superintelligent entities that could result in existential threats. AI development must be approached with caution, rigorous testing, and an understanding that intelligence, while a powerful tool, is not a panacea for all challenges nor an omnipotent force.
