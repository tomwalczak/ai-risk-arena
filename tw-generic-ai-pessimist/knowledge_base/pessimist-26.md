2. Argument from Global Negligence towards AI Risk Management

The widespread failure to adequately invest in understanding and mitigating AI risks reveals a dangerous complacency within the global community. This indifference can be seen in the superficial breadth of the current debate on AI safety, which often lacks the depth necessary to fully grasp the potential hazards AI poses, leading to potentially insufficient risk mitigation strategies. A poignant example of this is the general underestimation of AI's existential risks when compared to more tangible threats like climate change. In a similar vein to how past generations overemphasized the fear of running out of oil, today's society may be misallocating its concerns, paying insufficient attention to the substantial and nuanced risks associated with AI control over the physical universe.

Additionally, the potential for AI to cause catastrophic outcomes or large-scale loss of life is not merely speculative but a pressing concern that needs more rigorous investigation. The fact that there are unknowns in the realm of AI ethics, such as the moral value of digital life, further underlines the underdeveloped state of our understanding. This gap in knowledge and the taboo nature of such topics contribute to an environment where emerging threats may not be recognized or responded to in time.

Within the AI industry itself, the reaction to the possibility of catastrophic developments in AI varies, but there is an apparent undercurrent of concern among those who understand the gravity of the situation. The industry's focus tends to prioritize advancement over safety, which could lead to delayed or inadequate responses to emerging threats when they become evident. This lack of proactive engagement with the existential risks of AI, especially advanced general intelligence, is a ticking time bomb that we are ill-prepared to defuse. Without a significant shift in priorities towards robust AI risk research and mitigation efforts, we are leaving ourselves vulnerable to unforeseeable and potentially irreversible consequences.
