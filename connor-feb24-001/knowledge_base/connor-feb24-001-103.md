claim: "Risk aversion among funding bodies poses a significant obstacle to pioneering AI safety research."
premises:
  - claim: "Entities like EA and ASAP are criticized for their overly cautious funding strategies."
  - claim: "Despite having more resources, DARPA's willingness to embrace risk starkly contrasts with the conservative stance of smaller organizations."
  - claim: "The reluctance to fund potentially controversial or unsuccessful projects limits support for innovative, high-risk research."
counterargument_to:
  - "Funding bodies should primarily support low-risk, proven research avenues to ensure the best use of their resources."
  - "The conservative funding strategy of entities like EA and ASAP is justified given the high stakes of AI safety research."

strongest_objjection:
  - "A conservative funding strategy might be more efficient in the long run, as it ensures that only the most promising and well-vetted projects receive support, potentially reducing waste and focusing efforts on what is most likely to yield meaningful results."

consequences_if_true:
  - "Innovative and potentially groundbreaking AI safety research projects might go unfunded, slowing progress in the field."
  - "The field of AI safety could stagnate, becoming overly cautious and less able to respond to emerging threats or capitalize on new ideas."
  - "Researchers may be discouraged from pursuing ambitious projects, leading to a talent drain away from high-risk, high-reward research."

link_to_ai_safety: This argument highlights how risk aversion in funding can stifle progress in AI safety, a field that requires innovative approaches to address complex and uncertain challenges.

simple_explanation: Many funding bodies, despite their claims of supporting innovative research, are actually quite risk-averse, which poses a significant obstacle to pioneering AI safety research. Unlike DARPA, which is known for its high-risk, high-reward funding approach, smaller organizations tend to shy away from projects that could be controversial or fail, limiting support for potentially groundbreaking work. This conservative stance could hinder progress in AI safety, a field that desperately needs bold and unconventional ideas to tackle its challenges.

examples:
  - "DARPA's willingness to fund 'crazy, stupid bullshit' like invisibility cloaks, showcasing a high tolerance for risk and failure, in stark contrast to more cautious philanthropic organizations."
  - "The criticism faced by entities like EA and ASAP for their overly cautious funding strategies, despite having resources and claiming to support innovative research."
  - "The societal pressure on philanthropic organizations to avoid controversy and failure, exemplified by the backlash the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation received for funding a company that turned out to be shady."
