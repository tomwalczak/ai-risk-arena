claim: "The development of science and technology significantly involves activity beyond the internal cognitive processes of individual human brains, utilizing external systems and tools."
premises:
  - claim: "Advancement in science and technology is a product of both internal cognitive processes and external systems, including tools, institutions, and environments."
  - claim: "An alien observer mapping the causal graph of technological advancement would note a substantial portion of activity occurring outside human brains, suggesting these external processes are less complex than internal cognitive operations."
counterargument_to:
  - "The development of science and technology is solely a product of the internal cognitive processes within individual human brains."

strongest_objection:
  - "External tools and systems, while important, do not fundamentally change the nature of scientific and technological advancements, which are primarily driven by human intellect and creativity."

consequences_if_true:
  - "If true, this suggests a reevaluation of the role of individual genius in science and technology, emphasizing collaboration and the use of external tools."
  - "Educational and institutional practices may shift to further encourage the use of external systems and collaborative environments."
  - "This understanding could lead to a more inclusive view of intelligence, recognizing the contributions of both internal cognitive abilities and external aids."

link_to_ai_safety: This argument highlights the importance of designing AI systems that can effectively integrate and leverage external tools and systems, similar to how humans achieve scientific and technological advancements.

simple_explanation: The development of science and technology isn't just about what happens inside our brains. It's also massively about the tools, institutions, and environments we use. Imagine an alien trying to understand how we advance technology; they'd see a lot of the action happening outside our heads, with our tools and systems playing key roles. This shows that science and technology are collaborative achievements, not just the result of individual brainpower.

examples:
  - "The use of laboratories and scientific instruments in experiments extends our cognitive capabilities beyond what our brains can process alone."
  - "Collaborative platforms and communication technologies enable the sharing of complex ideas and data among scientists, facilitating advancements."
  - "The development of computer algorithms and models that can simulate experiments or predict outcomes, serving as external cognitive processes that aid in scientific discovery."
