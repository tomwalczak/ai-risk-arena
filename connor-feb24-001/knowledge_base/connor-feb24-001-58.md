claim: "There's a potential overlap with the cyborg research agenda but with a distinct approach of using emulated rather than alien cortexes."
premises:
  - claim: "The goal is to enhance human intelligence by interfacing with an AI that operates like a human cortex."
  - claim: "This approach differs by emulating human cognitive processes for a more natural integration, unlike the cyborg agenda's use of alien cortexes."
counterargument_to:
  - Cyborg research agendas prioritize integrating alien (non-human) cognitive systems into human intelligence enhancement.

strongest_objjection:
  - The emulation of human cognitive processes may not surpass the efficiency or capability of integrating alien cortexes, potentially limiting the scope of intelligence enhancement.

consequences_if_true:
  - This approach could lead to a more seamless integration between human and artificial intelligence, reducing the likelihood of cognitive dissonance.
  - It may foster a deeper understanding of human cognition by reverse-engineering the cognitive processes.
  - The emulation of human-like AI could significantly advance AI safety by ensuring AI systems are more predictable and aligned with human values.

link_to_ai_safety: This strategy directly ties to AI safety by emphasizing the alignment of AI behavior with human cognitive and ethical norms.

simple_explanation: Imagine we're trying to make humans smarter by connecting our brains to a computer that thinks just like us. Instead of using a completely foreign "brain" or cortex from something not human, we're copying how our own minds work to make this connection feel natural and easy to integrate. This means we could improve how we think without the weirdness or confusion that might come from merging our minds with something that doesn't think like anything on Earth. It's like having a super smart friend who thinks just like you do, helping you out.

examples:
  - Emulating a digital twin of a human brain for enhanced decision-making without the ethical dilemmas of integrating non-human intelligence.
  - A learning assistant AI that models the user's cognitive patterns for personalized education.
  - Advanced prosthetics that integrate seamlessly with the user's neural patterns, enhancing both physical and cognitive capabilities.
