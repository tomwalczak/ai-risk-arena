claim: "Most people do not attempt horrific acts primarily due to a combination of moral constraints and a lack of capability."
premises:
  - claim: "The inherent morality or incapability of the vast majority prevents widespread chaos."
  - claim: "Reliance on the goodness or ineptitude of most individuals acts as a deterrent against mass horrific actions."
counterargument_to:
  - The belief that higher intelligence or capability naturally leads to moral or benevolent behavior.
  - The assumption that horrific acts are primarily driven by external factors rather than internal moral or capability constraints.

strongest_objection:
  - The existence of highly intelligent or capable individuals who have committed horrific acts suggests that morality and capability are not sufficient deterrents on their own.

consequences_if_true:
  - Societal stability relies significantly on the innate morality and incapability of the majority rather than just on external enforcement or deterrence.
  - Enhancing the moral education and ethical reasoning capabilities of individuals could be a more effective way to prevent horrific acts than increasing surveillance or punitive measures.
  - Understanding the limitations and moral inclinations of AI becomes crucial in preventing potential misuse or harmful actions by artificial intelligences.

simple_explanation: Most people don't commit terrible acts, not because they can't or because there are strict laws against it, but because they inherently know it's wrong or lack the means to do so. This combination of knowing what's wrong and not being able to do much even if they wanted to acts like an invisible barrier that keeps society functioning. It's like having an internal police officer and jail cell that most of us carry around, which stops us from doing bad things even when no one's watching.

examples:
  - The majority of people, despite sometimes facing extreme provocation or being in situations where they could commit crimes without immediate consequences, choose not to do so.
  - Historical figures who had significant intelligence and capability but chose to use their talents for the betterment of society, rather than causing harm.
  - The observation that even in lawless or post-apocalyptic scenarios depicted in fiction, there are always individuals or groups who strive to maintain order and morality, reflecting an inherent sense of right and wrong.
