claim: "Cognitive emulations (CoMs) offer a pathway towards understandable AI systems"
premises:
  - claim: "CoMs aim to emulate human-like reasoning in a manner that is bounded and understandable."
  - claim: "By providing a causal explanation for their decisions, CoMs are designed to be more transparent and trustworthy."
counterargument_to:
  - "AI systems based purely on machine learning without human-like reasoning are sufficient for safety and understandability."

strongest_objection:
  - "Creating cognitive emulations that accurately and reliably replicate human-like reasoning might be technically infeasible or ethically problematic, given the complexity of human cognition and the ethical considerations surrounding emulation of consciousness."

consequences_if_true:
  - "AI systems would become more transparent, allowing users and developers to understand the reasoning behind decisions and outputs."
  - "Trust in AI systems would potentially increase, as users can relate to and comprehend the decision-making process."
  - "It could lead to the development of safer AI systems, as their decisions and actions would be more predictable and aligned with human reasoning."

link_to_ai_safety: This argument is directly linked to AI safety by proposing a pathway to develop AI systems whose decision-making processes are understandable and aligned with human values.

simple_explanation: Cognitive Emulations (CoMs) are an innovative approach aimed at making AI systems safer and more useful by emulating human-like reasoning. Unlike traditional AI, which can sometimes operate in a "black box," CoMs are designed to solve problems in ways that humans would, providing clear, causal explanations for their actions. This makes them not only more understandable but also more trustworthy, as we can relate to and follow their decision-making process.

examples:
  - "A CoM-based medical diagnosis AI that not only identifies diseases but also explains the symptoms and reasoning that led to its conclusion, similar to how a human doctor would."
  - "An AI personal assistant that plans your day based on your preferences and goals, clearly explaining why it made certain choices, in a way that reflects human decision-making."
  - "A CoM-driven autonomous vehicle that can explain its actions during driving, such as why it took a sudden detour, in a manner akin to a human driver explaining their decisions."
