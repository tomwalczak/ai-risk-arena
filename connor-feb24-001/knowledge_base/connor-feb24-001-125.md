claim: "The concept of AGI is evolving and may no longer be useful as a term."
premises:
  - claim: "Definitions of AGI vary significantly, with some current AI systems meeting previous criteria for AGI."
  - claim: "The term AGI has become contentious and may not accurately reflect the capabilities or goals of current AI research."
counterargument_to:
  - "The term AGI is clear and consistently defines a specific level of AI capability that is universally understood."
  - "We should continue to use the term AGI as it accurately reflects the goals and current state of AI research."

strongest_objection:
  - "The evolving definition of AGI might reflect the natural progression of any scientific field, where terms evolve as the field advances and this does not necessarily invalidate the usefulness of the term."

consequences_if_true:
  - "Researchers and the public might have misaligned expectations about the capabilities and goals of AI, leading to confusion or misplaced trust."
  - "Funding and policy decisions regarding AI research could be misdirected due to ambiguous goals or expectations."
  - "The AI community might need to develop a new terminology or framework to more accurately describe and guide the research and development of advanced AI systems."

link_to_ai_safety: The evolving concept of AGI is intrinsically linked to AI safety, as a clear understanding and consensus on what constitutes AGI is essential for assessing and mitigating potential risks.

simple_explanation: The concept of AGI, or Artificial General Intelligence, is becoming increasingly muddled as different people use it to mean very different things. What was once considered AGI, such as the ability to perform a wide range of tasks at human level, is now achievable by current AI systems like GPT-4. This inconsistency in definition not only makes the term AGI contentious but may also render it obsolete, failing to accurately capture the aspirations or achievements of modern AI research. We might need new terminology to describe the evolving landscape of AI capabilities and goals more clearly.

examples:
  - "A decade ago, AGI was thought to require human-like reasoning across a broad spectrum of tasks, a benchmark some current AI systems now meet."
  - "The term AGI can be contentious, with some envisioning it as a friendly human-like robot, while others imagine a godlike superintelligence."
  - "The goal of creating an AI that can invent solutions or conduct science, as mentioned in the transcript, shows how the aspirations for AGI have shifted beyond traditional definitions."
