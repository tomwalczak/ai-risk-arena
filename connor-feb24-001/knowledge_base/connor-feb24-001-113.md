link_to_ai_safety: This argument underscores the importance of harnessing market dynamics to ensure sufficient funding for AI safety research.

simple_explanation: 
The reliance on for-profit models for funding is not about choosing profit over ethics but about pragmatism in securing resources in our current society. Startups, especially in tech, can quickly scale and attract significant investment, making them an optimal choice for growth given today's market dynamics. This isn't an ideological stance but a practical response to how resources are allocated in society right now. Though the situation could change, for now, for-profit models offer a viable path for funding initiatives like AI safety research, which might otherwise struggle to secure necessary funds.

examples:
  - "The rapid growth and scale of tech startups in the last two decades, facilitated by venture capital."
  - "The use of for-profit models by research companies like Conjecture to fund AI alignment research."
  - "The reliance on for-profit entities to drive innovation in sectors like renewable energy, showcasing the model's ability to attract investment for socially beneficial projects."
