claim: "Eliezer's research focuses on building formal models of agency and intelligence"
premises:
  - claim: "MIRI, founded by Eliezer, aims to clarify concepts of agency and intelligence at a fundamental level."
  - claim: "Eliezer's work involves developing formal theories on key concepts such as agency, alignment, corrigibility, and decision theory."
counterargument_to:
  - claim: "Formal models and first principles are not essential for advancing AI safety and understanding intelligence."
  - claim: "Practical, experimental approaches in AI development are sufficient to address AI alignment and agency."

strongest_objjection:
  - "Developing formal models of agency and intelligence is too abstract and removed from practical AI development, making it difficult to apply these models to real-world AI systems."

consequences_if_true:
  - "If Eliezer's research proves successful, it could provide a foundational understanding of intelligence and agency, leading to more robust and aligned AI systems."
  - "A formalized approach to understanding agency and intelligence could lead to new methodologies in AI safety, potentially preventing catastrophic failures."
  - "Success in this area might shift the focus of AI research towards more theoretical work, possibly slowing down immediate practical applications but ensuring long-term safety and alignment."

link_to_ai_safety: Eliezer's research is directly linked to AI safety by aiming to solve fundamental problems of agency and alignment, which are crucial for ensuring that AI systems act in ways that are beneficial to humans.

simple_explanation: Eliezer Yudkowsky's research is focused on understanding the very essence of what it means to be intelligent and how to make decisions - basically, what makes an AI an AI, and how we can make sure it does what we want safely. He's not just trying to build smarter AI; he's trying to figure out the rules of the game itself, making sure we can trust AI and use it to our advantage. This involves diving deep into theoretical concepts and trying to create models that explain these ideas clearly, so we can build AI systems that are not only smart but also safe and aligned with our goals.

examples:
  - "Creating a mathematical model of 'agency' to better understand how AI systems can make autonomous decisions."
  - "Developing theories on 'alignment' to ensure AI systems' goals are in line with human values."
  - "Exploring 'decision theory' as a way to predict how AI systems will make choices in complex situations."
