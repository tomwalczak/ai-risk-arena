claim: "Surviving cybersecurity breaches doesn't imply that systems with existential risks can have security failures."
premises:
  - claim: "Survival from cybersecurity breaches is due to the non-existential nature of these threats."
  - claim: "Existentially dangerous systems require security to work 100% of the time."
counterargument_to:
  - "Systems that have survived cybersecurity breaches prove that even systems with existential risks can occasionally have security failures without leading to catastrophic outcomes."
  - "The resilience of current systems to cybersecurity threats indicates that not all security failures in existentially dangerous systems would necessarily lead to disaster."

strongest_objection:
  - "The complexity and unpredictability of existentially dangerous systems may allow for unforeseen safety mechanisms or fail-safes that could prevent a total failure even if security is breached."

consequences_if_true:
  - "A much higher standard of security and reliability is required for systems with existential risk than for conventional systems."
  - "The development and deployment of systems with existential risks, such as advanced AI, must be approached with utmost caution and rigorous security measures."
  - "Failure to ensure 100% security in existentially dangerous systems could result in irreversible consequences for humanity."

link_to_ai_safety: This argument underscores the imperative of foolproof security in the development of advanced artificial intelligence to prevent catastrophic outcomes.

simple_explanation: Just because we've managed to get through cybersecurity breaches without facing the end of the world doesn't mean we can be lax about the security of systems that could pose an existential threat. These kinds of systems, like superintelligent AI, need to be secure all the time, every time. It's not just about hoping for the best; it's about ensuring that there’s no chance of a catastrophic failure, because even one small oversight could lead to disastrous consequences.

examples:
  - "The near-misses in nuclear weapon security during the Cold War, where accidents or miscalculations could have led to nuclear war, illustrate how even highly secure systems can have vulnerabilities."
  - "Stuxnet, a highly sophisticated computer worm, showed how even state-of-the-art security measures can be circumvented by determined and resourceful adversaries, posing risks to critical infrastructure."
  - "The theoretical scenario of an AI-driven 'paperclip maximizer' that turns the world into paperclips due to a single unchecked directive, exemplifies how a small oversight in an AI’s goal-setting could lead to existential disaster."
