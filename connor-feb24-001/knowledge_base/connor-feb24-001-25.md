claim: "An alternative to building AI systems based on 'magic' is to create cognitive emulations of human intelligence."
premises:
  - claim: "Current AI systems are built using principles that are not fully understood ('magic')."
    example: "AI systems today are often described as operating on 'magical' principles, due to the lack of understanding about how they work."
  - claim: "Cognitive emulations would base AI on a more comprehensible model, potentially mitigating some ethical and safety concerns."
    example: "By basing AI on cognitive emulations of human intelligence, the technology could become more understandable, addressing some ethical and safety concerns."
counterargument_to:
  - "The best approach to AI development is through enhancing computational power and algorithms without needing to replicate human cognitive processes."

strongest_objjection:
  - "Creating cognitive emulations of human intelligence could be incredibly complex and resource-intensive, potentially slowing down AI development."

consequences_if_true:
  - "AI systems would become more transparent, making it easier for humans to understand and trust their decisions."
  - "Ethical and safety concerns in AI could be more directly addressed, potentially leading to a safer integration of AI into society."
  - "The approach could facilitate more natural interactions between humans and AI, as the AI's reasoning process would be more relatable."

link_to_ai_safety: This argument is intrinsically linked to AI safety as it proposes a method to make AI's decision-making processes understandable and predictable, thus potentially reducing the risks associated with powerful AI systems.

simple_explanation: Currently, AI systems often work in ways that even their creators don't fully understand, described by some as 'magic.' The argument suggests shifting towards building AI that emulates human cognitive processes, making AI's decisions easier to understand and trust. This could address significant ethical and safety concerns by ensuring AI systems make choices in a human-like, comprehensible manner. Essentially, it's about making AI's thought process more like ours, so we can better predict and control its actions.

examples:
  - "A cognitive emulation AI could solve a complex math problem step-by-step in a manner similar to a human mathematician, providing clear explanations for each step."
  - "In diagnosing a patient, such an AI would assess symptoms and medical history in a discernible, logical sequence akin to a human doctor's diagnostic process, making its conclusions transparent and understandable."
  - "For decision-making in autonomous vehicles, the AI could evaluate scenarios and make decisions based on a process similar to human ethical and safety considerations, which could be explained and understood by humans."
