claim: "AI models can contribute to the scientific process without being impossibly complex."
premises:
  - claim: "With assistance from language models, the scientific process can become legible and built upon a causal story of trust."
  - claim: "The scientific process, similar to the design and functionality of everyday objects like headphones, can be understood through a causal story, making each step explainable without superhuman capabilities."
counterargument_to:
  - AI models must be of superhuman complexity to contribute meaningfully to the scientific process.
  - The scientific process is too complex to be assisted or enhanced by current AI technologies.

strongest_objection:
  - The intricacies and unpredictabilities of scientific discovery cannot be effectively captured or facilitated by AI models, as these models lack the creativity and intuition of human researchers.

consequences_if_true:
  - The scientific process could be democratized, with more people able to understand and contribute to science due to the legibility provided by AI models.
  - Trust in scientific findings could increase as the causal story behind discoveries becomes more accessible and understandable.
  - The pace of scientific discovery could accelerate, as AI models assist in breaking down complex tasks into understandable parts.

link_to_ai_safety: This argument is directly linked to AI safety as it proposes a model where AI assists in the scientific process in a legible, trust-building manner, ensuring that AI developments are aligned with human understanding and control.

simple_explanation: Imagine AI models as tools that make the complex world of science more like reading a well-written story. Just as you can understand how your headphones work by following their blueprint, AI can help outline the scientific process in steps that make sense to us. This doesn't require the AI to be superhuman or unfathomably complex; it just needs to work alongside us, making each step of the discovery process clear and trustworthy. In essence, AI can serve as a guide, helping us navigate through scientific inquiries without taking unexplainable leaps of logic.

examples:
  - Like breaking down the engineering and design process of headphones into understandable steps, AI can help deconstruct scientific theories and experiments into simpler, comprehensible parts.
  - AI models could translate complex scientific data into narratives or visualizations that explain causality and correlation in a way that’s easy for non-experts to grasp.
  - In the same way that collaborative software allows for the breakdown of large projects into manageable tasks, AI could assist in partitioning scientific problems into sub-tasks that are easier for humans to tackle and understand.
