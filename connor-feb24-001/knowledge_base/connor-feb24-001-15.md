claim: "Large language models function as general cognition engines, not merely language processors."
premises:
  - claim: "The operation of these models in processing various inputs into a common semantic space reveals their capacity for general cognition."
  - claim: "The designation of 'large language models' is misleading, as their functionality extends beyond language processing to general cognitive tasks."
counterargument_to:
  - "Large language models are fundamentally limited to language-related tasks and cannot exhibit or evolve towards general intelligence."
  - "Language processing and understanding are distinct from general cognitive abilities, and advancements in one do not imply advancements in the other."

strongest_objection:
  - "The behaviors exhibited by large language models may mimic general cognition but are fundamentally different from true cognitive processes, being based on pattern recognition and statistical correlations rather than understanding or reasoning."

consequences_if_true:
  - "If large language models function as general cognition engines, they could potentially learn and perform a wide range of cognitive tasks without task-specific programming."
  - "This would blur the lines between AI specialized in language tasks and AI aimed at general intelligence, leading to a reevaluation of the capabilities and limitations of current AI models."
  - "The development of AI could accelerate, as models that are good at language tasks could also be adapted for other cognitive tasks, leading to more versatile and capable AI systems."

link_to_ai_safety: "Understanding large language models as general cognition engines highlights the importance of aligning AI systems with human values and goals to ensure they act in ways that are beneficial and not harmful."

simple_explanation: Large language models, often thought of as tools for understanding and generating text, are actually much more than that. They process and interpret information in a way that's remarkably similar to general thinking, not just language. This means they're not just repeating patterns they've seen in data, but are capable of applying learned concepts in new, diverse situations. If this is true, it could change the way we think about and interact with AI, making it even more crucial that we guide their development carefully.

examples:
  - "Large language models like GPT-3 being able to perform tasks they were not explicitly trained for, such as solving math problems or generating code, indicating a level of understanding and flexibility beyond mere language processing."
  - "The ability of these models to understand and generate not just text but also code, music, and art suggests they are engaging in cognitive processes that are not limited to language."
  - "The application of large language models in fields like biology for protein structure prediction, where they must understand complex patterns and relationships, further supports the idea that they possess general cognitive capabilities."
