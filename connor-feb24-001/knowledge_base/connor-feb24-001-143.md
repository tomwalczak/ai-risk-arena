link_to_ai_safety: This argument highlights the inherent challenges in communicating nuanced and complex views on AI safety, which is crucial for informed policy-making and public understanding.

simple_explanation: Communicating about AI safety is tough, not just because the ideas are complex, but also because even experts can misunderstand each other. Imagine trying to explain a rainbow to someone who sees in black and white; no matter how hard you try, something gets lost in translation. That's similar to what happens when we talk about AI safety - the nuances and complexities make it hard to get the full picture across, leading to misunderstandings and oversimplifications.

examples:
  - Paul's opinions on AI safety being mischaracterized by those close to him show how easily complex ideas can be misunderstood.
  - The conflation of AI risk with biological risk in Mustafa Suleyman's writings illustrates the difficulty of communicating nuanced views without oversimplification.
  - The misrepresentation of AI safety arguments as clickbait headlines indicates a broader issue with conveying the subtleties of these discussions in media.
