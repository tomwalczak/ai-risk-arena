claim: "The minimum viable catastrophe in today's context is likely to arise from overlooked vulnerabilities rather than from superintelligent AI or advanced technologies."
premises:
  - claim: "Historical events and discussions with professionals reveal that significant threats frequently exploit basic, overlooked vulnerabilities."
  - claim: "Examples such as the lack of protection against drones demonstrate how simple oversight can lead to significant security threats."
counterargument_to:
  - The notion that superintelligent AI or highly advanced technologies are the primary existential risks humanity faces.
  - Beliefs that sophisticated technological threats are the most likely source of a minimum viable catastrophe.

strongest_objection:
  - Advanced technologies and AI might evolve unpredictably, creating unforeseen vulnerabilities or scenarios that could indeed pose existential risks, thus undermining the focus on current, known oversights.

consequences_if_true:
  - Prioritization of resources towards identifying and addressing basic vulnerabilities over investing in speculative advanced technology threats.
  - A shift in public and policy discourse towards enhancing everyday security measures and resilience.
  - Increased cross-disciplinary collaboration between technologists, policymakers, and security professionals to preemptively address overlooked vulnerabilities.

link_to_ai_safety: This argument underscores the importance of comprehensive AI safety measures that account for both advanced threats and basic vulnerabilities.

simple_explanation: When we worry about what might bring about catastrophic events, it's easy to get caught up in the idea of superintelligent AI or futuristic tech. However, history and expert insights show us that it's often the simple things we overlook that leave us most vulnerable. For example, failing to protect against something as accessible as drones can lead to major security issues. So, focusing on these basic oversights might actually be where we need to direct our attention to prevent potential disasters.

examples:
  - The lack of protection against drones, which has emerged as a significant security threat.
  - Historical events where simple technological or procedural oversights led to catastrophic outcomes, such as the Chernobyl disaster.
  - Cybersecurity incidents exploiting basic vulnerabilities, like the WannaCry ransomware attack exploiting outdated systems.
