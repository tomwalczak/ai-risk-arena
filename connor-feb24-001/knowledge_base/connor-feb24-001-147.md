claim: "Formal models and theory are crucial for developing safe AI"
premises:
  - claim: "Clarifying agency and alignment through formal models is a significant aspect of AI safety."
  - claim: "Ideally, theoretical groundwork would extensively precede the development of AGI to ensure safety."
counterargument_to:
  - "Formal models and theory are not necessary for AI development; practical, experimental approaches are sufficient."
  - "The development of AI can proceed safely without a solid theoretical foundation, relying on trial and error and iterative improvements."

strongest_objection:
  - "Formal models and theories can be overly abstract and may not accurately capture the complexities of real-world AI behavior, leading to a false sense of security."

consequences_if_true:
  - "Emphasizing formal models and theory would lead to a deeper understanding of AI behavior and its potential risks."
  - "A theoretical foundation would enable the development of more robust and reliable AI systems, reducing the likelihood of unintended harmful consequences."
  - "The process of AI development would become more deliberate and cautious, prioritizing safety and alignment from the outset."

link_to_ai_safety: This argument underscores the importance of theoretical underpinnings in ensuring AI systems operate safely and in alignment with human values and intentions.

simple_explanation: To ensure the safety of artificial intelligence, especially as we approach the development of AGI (Artificial General Intelligence), it's crucial that we ground our work in solid theoretical models. These models help clarify the goals and behaviors we expect from AI, ensuring they act in ways that are beneficial and aligned with our values. Without this foundation, we risk developing AI systems that are unpredictable and potentially dangerous. Theoretical groundwork acts as a map, guiding us towards safe AI development.

examples:
  - "Anthropic’s Constitutional AI approach, which uses Reinforcement Learning to align AI behavior with a set of principles, showcases the practical application of theory to solve alignment problems."
  - "The development of formal verification methods in software engineering, which could be adapted to verify the safety and alignment of AI systems."
  - "Historical precedents in other fields, such as the role of theory in the development of nuclear energy, illustrate how theoretical understanding precedes safe and practical application."
