claim: "A significant portion of human cognition occurs outside the brain, through tools, art, and interaction with other people."
premises:
  - claim: "Human cognition often involves externalizing thought processes into tools or delegating them to others for effective problem-solving."
  - claim: "The ability to use tools and other people as cognitive extensions is a fundamental aspect of human intelligence."
counterargument_to:
  - The notion that human cognition is entirely contained within the brain and does not significantly rely on external elements.

strongest_objection:
  - Critics might argue that the reliance on external tools and others for cognition is merely a byproduct of social and cultural evolution rather than an intrinsic aspect of human intelligence.

consequences_if_true:
  - It would imply that intelligence is not solely an internal, solitary process, but a distributed phenomenon that spans individuals and their environment.
  - Educational and technological systems might need to be redesigned to better leverage this distributed nature of human cognition.
  - It could redefine the understanding of individual intelligence by emphasizing the importance of collaborative and tool-based problem-solving.

link_to_ai_safety: This argument suggests that AI systems designed to mimic human intelligence might need to incorporate the ability to use and interact with external tools and agents for true cognitive functionality.

simple_explanation: Imagine your mind as not just your brain but as a network that extends beyond it, using tools like calculators for math or discussing ideas with friends to enhance understanding. This concept suggests that a significant part of how we think and solve problems involves these external aids. Therefore, being intelligent isn't just about what's happening inside our heads but also about how effectively we use the world and the people around us to extend our cognitive capabilities.

examples:
  - Using a notebook as an external memory aid to free up cognitive resources.
  - Collaborating with a group of people on a complex problem to access a wider range of knowledge and perspectives.
  - Utilizing computer software to perform complex calculations that are beyond our immediate mental capacity.
