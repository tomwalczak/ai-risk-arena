claim: "Impact markets are impractical in our current societal structure despite their theoretical potential."
premises:
  - claim: "Impact markets fail due to practical, contingent reasons rather than inherent flaws, suggesting potential in smarter societies."
  - claim: "Our society's current mechanisms and structures are not conducive to the practical implementation of impact markets."
counterargument_to:
  - "Impact markets can be seamlessly integrated into our current societal structures."
  - "The theoretical potential of impact markets outweighs practical concerns."

strongest_objection:
  - "The concept of impact markets could evolve alongside societal structures, becoming more feasible as societies become smarter and technology advances."

consequences_if_true:
  - "A reevaluation of our societal structures and mechanisms may be necessary to unlock the potential of impact markets."
  - "Efforts to implement impact markets prematurely could result in wasted resources and disillusionment with the concept."
  - "A focus on enhancing societal intelligence and adaptability could indirectly facilitate the practical implementation of impact markets."

link_to_ai_safety: The impracticality of impact markets in our current society underscores the need for cautious and informed integration of AI into complex societal systems.

simple_explanation: Despite their theoretical appeal, impact markets are not currently viable because our society's existing structures don't support them. This isn't because the idea itself is flawed but because our mechanisms for implementing such concepts haven't evolved to handle their complexity. If our society becomes smarter, more adaptable, and technologically advanced, the practical implementation of impact markets could become more feasible. This suggests a need for a gradual approach, focusing on societal and technological evolution.

examples:
  - "The use of AI in legal systems, as mentioned in the transcript, shows the complexity and potential for perverse outcomes when advanced systems are introduced into existing structures without adequate adaptation."
  - "The concept of carbon credits, a form of impact market, struggles with practical issues like verification and enforcement within current international frameworks."
  - "Crowdfunding for social causes, while not a full impact market, illustrates both the potential and limitations of leveraging market mechanisms for societal impact under current conditions."
