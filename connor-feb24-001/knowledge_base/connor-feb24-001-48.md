claim: "Creating an AI that can perform human-level science without causing harm is a critical success criterion."
premises:
  - claim: "Such AI must be operated responsibly, adhering to strict protocols to prevent dangerous outcomes."
  - claim: "The aim is not absolute safety regardless of user actions but safety conditional on the system being used as intended."
counterargument_to:
  - AI can be developed with flexibility and general intelligence without specific safeguards, as it will naturally align with human values and safety.
  - The development of AI should prioritize advancement and capabilities over safety concerns, assuming responsible use by operators.

strongest_objection:
  - How can we ensure that the protocols and safety measures remain effective as AI continues to learn and evolve beyond its initial programming?

consequences_if_true:
  - The development of AI systems would include rigorous safety protocols, significantly reducing the risk of unintended harmful outcomes.
  - AI research would shift towards ensuring that AI systems are not only intelligent but also inherently safe, prioritizing human welfare.
  - There would be a greater emphasis on the ethical implications of AI, leading to more responsible AI development and deployment practices.

link_to_ai_safety: This argument is fundamentally about AI safety, emphasizing the importance of designing AI systems that are inherently safe and operate within intended parameters.

simple_explanation: Creating an AI capable of performing at human-level science without causing harm is essential. This means designing AI systems that are not only intelligent but also follow strict safety protocols to prevent dangerous outcomes. The goal isn't to make an AI that is safe no matter how it's misused but to ensure it remains safe when used correctly. This approach ensures that AI can be a powerful tool for humanity, without posing undue risks.

examples:
  - Nuclear reactors are designed to produce energy efficiently while having strict safety measures to prevent meltdowns. Similarly, AI should be designed to perform tasks effectively while preventing harmful outcomes.
  - Pharmaceutical drugs are developed to treat diseases with the condition of being used as prescribed; misuse can lead to adverse effects. Similarly, AI should be safe when used as intended.
  - Air traffic control systems are designed to manage the safe flow of aircraft in and out of airports. They operate effectively within the parameters of their design and protocols to prevent accidents.
