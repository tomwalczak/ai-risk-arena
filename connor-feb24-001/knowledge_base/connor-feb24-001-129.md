claim: "The world might end before more than 10% of cars on the streets are autonomous."
premises:
  - claim: "This forecast is grounded in the current technological trends."
  - claim: "It indicates a swift progression towards transformative or potentially catastrophic AI developments."
counterargument_to:
  - Autonomous vehicles will become a common sight on our roads in the near future.
  - The development and adoption of autonomous vehicles will significantly precede major transformative or catastrophic AI developments.

strongest_objection:
  - The development of autonomous vehicles and AI safety measures could advance concurrently, reducing the likelihood of a catastrophic event before their widespread adoption.
  - Technological innovation, especially in AI, is unpredictable, and barriers to autonomous vehicle adoption may be overcome faster than expected.

consequences_if_true:
  - The rapid development of AI could lead to transformative or catastrophic outcomes before society fully adapts to autonomous vehicles.
  - A focus on AI safety and ethical considerations becomes crucial to prevent potential catastrophic developments.
  - The pace of technological advancement in areas like autonomous vehicles could be overshadowed by the urgency of addressing AI safety concerns.

link_to_ai_safety: This argument emphasizes the importance of prioritizing AI safety to prevent potentially catastrophic developments that could precede significant technological milestones, such as the widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles.

simple_explanation: 
Imagine we're in a race where autonomous cars represent technological progress we can see and touch. However, lurking in the shadows is the rapid advancement of AI, which could lead to massive changes or even dangerous scenarios before these cars become a common sight. This isn't just about cool new tech hitting the streets; it's a cautionary tale urging us to pay attention to AI's potential risks before they outpace our readiness for them. In essence, we might be so close to creating AI that could drastically change our world, or even harm it, that this leap in technology could happen before we see more than 10% of cars driving themselves around.

examples:
  - The rapid development of AI language models that could potentially lead to transformative or uncontrollable AI before autonomous vehicles are widely adopted.
  - Historical instances of technological leaps, like the internet, which transformed society in unforeseen ways before regulations and societal norms could catch up.
  - The development of nuclear technology, which showcased how technological advancements could have catastrophic consequences without proper foresight and safety measures.
