claim: "Coordinating to slow down AI capabilities research among top labs would be the smart approach if humanity were to act intelligently."
premises:
  - claim: "Collaboration among leading AI labs to moderate progress could prevent a perilous race to advanced AI."
  - claim: "The argument that less scrupulous entities would take the lead is only valid under continued collective stupidity."
counterargument_to:
  - Accelerating AI capabilities research without limits is crucial for technological and economic advancement.
  - Any attempt to slow down AI research would be futile given the competitive nature of the field.

strongest_objjection:
  - Slowing down AI research could hamper innovation and economic growth, potentially causing stagnation in technological advancements.

consequences_if_true:
  - A coordinated effort to moderate AI research pace might lead to more thoughtful and safer development of AI technologies.
  - It could prevent a dangerous race towards unchecked AI capabilities, reducing the risk of creating uncontrollable or harmful AI.
  - Such cooperation could establish a global precedent for responsible science and technology development, influencing other fields.

link_to_ai_safety: This argument emphasizes the importance of a cautious approach to AI development, prioritizing safety and ethical considerations over speed.

simple_explanation: If humanity acted in its best interest, leading AI labs like DeepMind and OpenAI would work together to slow down their research. This isn't about stopping progress; it's about making sure we don't rush into creating advanced AI without understanding the risks. The idea that less ethical companies would just take over is a weak argument if we all agree to prioritize safety over speed. By coordinating, we can ensure AI benefits everyone without leading to catastrophic outcomes.

examples:
  - The coordinated global response to limit the spread of nuclear weapons serves as a precedent for how slowing down can lead to safer outcomes.
  - The Montreal Protocol, where nations agreed to reduce substances that deplete the ozone layer, shows how global cooperation can solve complex challenges.
  - Historical pauses in research, like the Asilomar Conference on recombinant DNA, demonstrate how slowing down can allow time for setting safety standards.
