claim: "The feasibility and safety of AGI design are contingent truths, dependent on the current state of technology and understanding."
premises:
  - claim: "The current preference for black box components in AGI is due to their superior capabilities, despite the challenges they present for safety and understanding."
  - claim: "This preference is not inherent to AGI design but is a result of the current technological landscape and may change with future advancements."
counterargument_to:
  - "AGI design can achieve inherent safety and feasibility without considering the current technological and understanding limitations."
  - "The preference for black box components in AGI is a permanent characteristic of AGI development."

strongest_objection:
  - "Given the rapid advancement in AI technology, it's overly pessimistic to believe that we won't overcome the challenges of understanding and safely managing black box components in AGI."

consequences_if_true:
  - "Research and development in AGI would prioritize not just performance, but also transparency and safety, adapting to the evolving technological landscape."
  - "The approach to AGI safety protocols would be dynamic, changing with new insights and advancements in technology."
  - "There would be an increased emphasis on interdisciplinary research to better understand and mitigate the risks associated with the current state of AGI technology."

link_to_ai_safety: This argument highlights the importance of current technological capabilities and understanding in shaping the feasibility and safety of AGI, directly impacting AI safety efforts.

simple_explanation: The safety and possibility of creating AGI—advanced artificial intelligence—are not fixed truths but depend on our current technology and how well we understand it. Right now, we prefer to use "black box" components in AGI because they're really good at what they do, even though they make it harder to ensure the AGI is safe and understandable. This preference isn't set in stone; it's just where we are today, technologically speaking. As technology and our understanding of it evolve, so too will our approaches to designing AGI, potentially making it safer and more understandable.

examples:
  - "The evolution from rule-based AI systems to neural networks demonstrates a shift in preference due to technological advancements, affecting both capabilities and comprehensibility."
  - "Safety mechanisms in industries like nuclear power change over time with technological advancements, analogous to potential shifts in AGI safety strategies."
  - "The development of more interpretable machine learning models, such as attention mechanisms, shows how preferences and capabilities in AI design evolve with understanding."
