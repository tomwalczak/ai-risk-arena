simple_explanation: Critics of the for-profit model argue that companies are often more motivated by profit than by the welfare of society. This misalignment occurs because society does not always reward actions that are in its best interest, leading to a focus on activities that are profitable rather than those that are necessarily good. This can result in innovations that prioritize company gains over societal benefits, potentially overlooking important needs or creating harm.

examples:
  - "Pharmaceutical companies may prioritize medications that are more profitable over those that meet more pressing public health needs."
  - "Social media companies optimizing for user engagement and advertising revenue over the mental health and privacy of their users."
  - "Fossil fuel companies focusing on short-term profits rather than investing in sustainable and environmentally friendly energy alternatives."
