claim: "Not being stupid in terms of AI safety could significantly improve humanity's future prospects."
premises:
  - claim: "Avoiding stupidity, such as making prediction markets illegal in the US, could greatly outperform the current approach to AI safety and other areas."
  - claim: "A pattern of acting against collective interests, as seen in the prohibition of prediction markets, hinders progress and safety."
counterargument_to:
  - The belief that complex, high-investment solutions are the only way to significantly improve humanity's future prospects.

strongest_objjection:
  - Making prediction markets legal and avoiding other "stupid" actions might not be sufficient to address the complex, multifaceted challenges of AI safety and humanity's future.

consequences_if_true:
  - A shift in regulatory and societal attitudes towards more open, innovative approaches to problem-solving, including AI safety.
  - Potential unlocking of valuable insights and solutions through previously restricted or overlooked means, such as prediction markets.
  - Enhancement of humanity's ability to navigate future challenges with greater agility and awareness.

link_to_ai_safety: This argument highlights the importance of avoiding self-imposed limitations and inefficiencies, which is crucial for fostering a safe and beneficial AI development environment.

simple_explanation: Imagine we're on a team working on a complex project, but instead of leveraging all available tools and strategies, we arbitrarily limit ourselves - that's essentially what's happening on a global scale with issues like AI safety. The argument suggests that by merely avoiding these self-imposed limitations, such as the prohibition of prediction markets in the U.S., we could significantly enhance our ability to face future challenges, including those posed by AI. It's like saying, "Let's stop tying our hands behind our backs and start using all the resources we have available to solve problems effectively."

examples:
  - The illegality of prediction markets in the U.S. restricts a valuable tool for gauging future outcomes and making informed decisions.
  - Overly cautious or restrictive regulations on AI development could stifle innovation and prevent the development of beneficial technologies.
  - Failure to invest in or prioritize AI safety research due to bureaucratic inertia or short-sighted policies.
