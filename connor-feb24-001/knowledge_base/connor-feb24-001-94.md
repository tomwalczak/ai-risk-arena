link_to_ai_safety: This argument underscores the critical role government perception plays in mobilizing efforts towards AI safety, illustrating how national security concerns can drive significant advancements in safe AI development.

simple_explanation: If the US government views AI as a national threat, it could unite and mobilize towards decisive action, much like it has in past crises. This could lead to a focused and effective response to AI safety, ensuring that safety measures keep pace with advancements in AI technology. By framing AI safety as a matter of national security, the government could leverage its resources and authority to prevent potential AI-related catastrophes, making the development of AI safer for everyone.

examples:
  - "The US government's rapid mobilization in response to the Sputnik launch, leading to significant advancements in space technology and the creation of NASA."
  - "The concerted effort to enhance cybersecurity measures after recognizing cyber attacks as a national security threat."
  - "The Manhattan Project during World War II, where an unprecedented level of resources and collaboration led to the development of nuclear technology in a short span of time."
