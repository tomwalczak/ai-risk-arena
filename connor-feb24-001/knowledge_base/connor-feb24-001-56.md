claim: "AI systems should be designed as multiple parallel entities not smarter than humans to ensure safety."
premises:
  - claim: "This approach makes AI systems bounded, understandable, and allows for trust through a causal story."
  - claim: "Parallel entities, not exceeding human intelligence, ensure that each component operates in a human-like manner, maintaining the system's overall trustworthiness."
counterargument_to:
  - Single, highly advanced AI systems that far surpass human intelligence can be controlled and remain safe.

strongest_objection:
  - How can we ensure that multiple parallel entities do not collectively surpass human intelligence or coordinate in ways that become uncontrollable or unpredictable?

consequences_if_true:
  - Development of AI systems that are inherently safer because their capabilities are bounded by human-like intelligence.
  - Easier understanding and interaction between humans and AI, fostering a more integrated and cooperative relationship.
  - Increased public trust in AI technologies, as their operations and limitations are more relatable to human reasoning and ethics.

link_to_ai_safety: This approach is directly linked to AI safety by aiming to prevent the creation of uncontrollable superintelligent entities and ensuring AI development is aligned with human values and limitations.

simple_explanation: The idea here is to build AI systems as a collection of entities that each mirror human intelligence, rather than creating a single, superintelligent AI. This way, each AI component is understandable and operates in a way that's relatable to us, making the whole system more trustworthy and safer. Think of it like a team of experts, each brilliant within their field, but collectively working under the guidance and values of human operators, ensuring their actions are always aligned with our interests and safety.

examples:
  - A research lab where each scientist contributes to a project without any single scientist dominating the research direction, ensuring diverse, balanced, and safe progress.
  - A company where decisions are made by consensus among departments, each with a clear understanding of their domain, rather than by a single, all-powerful CEO.
  - Historical examples of human societies that thrived by distributing power and decision-making, avoiding the risks associated with absolute rulers or centralized control.
