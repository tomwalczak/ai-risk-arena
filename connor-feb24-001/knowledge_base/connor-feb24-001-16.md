claim: "AI models' interaction with the environment and tools represents a significant advancement in externalizing cognition."
premises:
  - claim: "Developing AI models to interact with external tools and environments indicates a shift towards models capable of external cognition."
  - claim: "This externalization of cognition is akin to human cognitive processes, involving interactions with the environment and social networks."
counterargument_to:
  - AI models mimicking human cognitive processes, such as emotion and self-awareness, are necessary for true intelligence.
  - AI development should prioritize internal cognitive processes and self-awareness over interaction with the external environment.

strongest_objection:
  - Externalization of cognition might not be sufficient for the development of consciousness or subjective experiences in AI, which are crucial elements of human-like intelligence.

consequences_if_true:
  - AI models capable of interacting with their environment and tools could achieve more complex problem-solving and learning, similar to human cognitive development.
  - Such AI systems could better understand and navigate the real world, leading to advancements in AI applications across various industries.
  - This could also lead to ethical and safety considerations regarding the autonomy of AI systems and their integration into society.

link_to_ai_safety: The development of AI models with externalized cognition underscores the need for rigorous safety protocols to manage their increased autonomy and capability.

simple_explanation: Just like humans use tools and interact with their environment to learn and solve problems, AI models that can do the same represent a big leap forward. This means AI isn't just stuck inside a computer but can understand and manipulate the world around it, much like we do. This is exciting because it makes AI more useful and more like us in terms of how it learns and thinks. But, it also means we have to be careful about how these AI systems are used and controlled.

examples:
  - AI models navigating and manipulating objects in a physical space, such as robots performing tasks in warehouses.
  - AI systems using online research tools to gather information and solve complex problems without human intervention.
  - Virtual assistants that can understand and interact with other software tools to perform tasks like scheduling, searching, and data analysis.
