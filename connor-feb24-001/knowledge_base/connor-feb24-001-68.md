claim: "Leveraging AI for economic value could be a key strategy to control AGI development."
premises:
  - claim: "Creating economic incentives can motivate entities to avoid pursuing dangerous AGI development."
  - claim: "This approach necessitates a coordinated effort to ensure the security and proper use of AI systems."
counterargument_to:
  - Unregulated AGI development is safer and more beneficial for economic growth.

strongest_objection:
  - Leveraging AI for economic value might prioritize short-term gains over long-term safety, potentially accelerating the race towards dangerous AGI.

consequences_if_true:
  - A framework would be established that aligns economic incentives with the safe development of AI, mitigating existential risks.
  - Entities involved in AI development would be more likely to collaborate on safety standards, enhancing global security.
  - Economic policies could be crafted to support research and development in AI safety technologies, fostering innovation in secure AI applications.

link_to_ai_safety: This argument connects economic strategies with AI safety by proposing an incentive structure that aligns profit motives with the cautious development of AGI.

simple_explanation: It's like convincing everyone in a race to slow down and follow the safety rules by showing them that doing so can actually make them win more in the long run. By creating economic incentives, we can encourage companies and researchers to focus on developing AI that's safe and beneficial for everyone. This way, the pursuit of profit supports, rather than endangers, our collective well-being and security. Coordinating these efforts ensures that AI serves humanity without posing existential risks.

examples:
  - Governments offering tax incentives for companies that adhere to agreed-upon AI safety standards.
  - Investment funds dedicated to startups focusing on secure, ethical AI applications, promoting both economic growth and safety.
  - International agreements that include economic benefits for countries that enforce strict AI safety and development guidelines.
