claim: "The process of doing science can be broken down into understandable and functional parts without requiring superhuman capabilities."
premises:
  - claim: "Science and technology development rely on cumulative, communicable knowledge rather than leaps of logic or unfathomable processes."
  - claim: "Each step in the development of a product or scientific discovery is explicable, involving no steps that are unfathomable to humans."
counterargument_to:
  - "The process of understanding and contributing to science and technology requires inherent genius or leaps of logic beyond the grasp of ordinary humans."
  - "Scientific and technological breakthroughs are the result of inexplicable inspiration rather than a structured, communicable process."

strongest_objection:
  - "Some aspects of creativity and innovation in science might not be fully explicable or decomposable into clear, understandable steps, especially in groundbreaking discoveries."

consequences_if_true:
  - "Science and technology education and participation could become more democratized, as the barriers to understanding are not insurmountable."
  - "Collaborative scientific endeavors might be enhanced, as each step of the process can be communicated and critiqued, leading to more robust discoveries."
  - "The design and development of AI, including AGI, can be made safer and more transparent, as these processes also follow the principle of being understandable and functional."

link_to_ai_safety: This argument underscores the importance of transparency and comprehensibility in AI development processes, which are crucial for ensuring AI safety.

simple_explanation: The essence of scientific and technological progress is not in sudden, inexplicable leaps of genius but in the gradual accumulation of knowledge that can be broken down into clear, understandable steps. This means that with the right approach and resources, anyone can contribute to and understand science, without needing superhuman intelligence. It's about building on what's already known and making each step of the process clear and accessible to others, much like how we trust and understand the technology we use daily, such as headphones.

examples:
  - "The development of vaccines, where years of prior research allowed scientists to quickly understand and create vaccines for COVID-19, showcases science as a cumulative, communicable process."
  - "Open-source software development, where code is built collaboratively and iteratively, making each part of the process understandable and accessible to contributors at different levels."
  - "Historical scientific discoveries, such as Newton's Laws, which were built upon the work of previous scientists and are now fundamental principles that can be taught and understood broadly."
