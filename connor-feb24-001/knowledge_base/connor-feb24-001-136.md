claim: "Creating an AI alignment scheme that the creator thinks is safe doesn't ensure actual safety."
premises:
  - claim: "People can create complex systems that they themselves can understand or break."
    example: "In cryptography, everyone can create a code complex enough that they themselves can break it."
  - claim: "This leads to a false sense of security regarding the safety of AI systems."
counterargument_to:
  - The belief that an AI alignment scheme designed by its creator is inherently safe.

strongest_objection:
  - Creators have a deep understanding of their own systems, which might enable them to anticipate and mitigate potential risks effectively.

consequences_if_true:
  - Overreliance on creators' perception of safety could lead to overlooking unforeseen AI behaviors.
  - It may result in underestimating the complexity and unpredictability of AI, increasing the risk of catastrophic outcomes.
  - A false sense of security could slow down or hinder the development of genuinely effective AI safety measures.

link_to_ai_safety: This argument underscores the complexity and unpredictability of AI systems, emphasizing the challenge of ensuring their alignment with human values and safety.

simple_explanation: Just because the person who made an AI thinks it's safe doesn't mean it actually is. It's like creating a secret code that only you can understand—just because you can make it and break it doesn't mean it's secure from everyone else. In the realm of AI, this becomes even more critical because we're dealing with systems that can think, learn, and evolve in ways we might not fully grasp. Believing we've made them safe based on our own understanding can lead us to miss risks that could have dire consequences.

examples:
  - In cryptography, it's a common pitfall to create a cryptographic scheme that the creator can understand and decrypt, mistakenly believing it to be secure against all potential attackers.
  - The history of software development is rife with instances where developers thought their systems were secure or bug-free, only to find them exploited by unforeseen vulnerabilities.
  - Complex financial systems designed to be robust have failed spectacularly, like the 2008 financial crisis, where models failed to predict or contain the collapse.
