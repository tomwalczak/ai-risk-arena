claim: "The race towards AGI may lead to more closed research practices in the AI community."
premises:
  - claim: "There is a noticeable shift towards withholding data and algorithms as the competition intensifies."
  - claim: "This trend could mark a departure from the traditionally open-source norms of AI research."
counterargument_to:
  - "Open research practices will continue despite the competition in AI development."
  - "The collaborative nature of the scientific community will prevent a shift towards closed research."

strongest_objjection:
  - "Closed research practices could accelerate AGI development by protecting intellectual property and encouraging significant investment from private entities."

consequences_if_true:
  - "It may create barriers to entry for new researchers and smaller institutions, leading to a concentration of AI research in a few hands."
  - "The pace of innovation could be slowed down due to reduced collaboration and sharing of ideas."
  - "There could be an increased risk of unethical AI development practices, as less oversight and peer review occurs."

link_to_ai_safety: Closed research practices in AI could hinder the global cooperative efforts needed to ensure the development of safe AGI systems.

simple_explanation: As competition in the race towards AGI intensifies, there's a noticeable shift towards keeping data and algorithms secret among researchers. This trend could lead to a significant change from the open-source culture that has traditionally fueled innovation in AI. If this continues, we might see a world where a few large entities control the progress towards AGI, making it difficult for others to contribute or even scrutinize the developments, potentially slowing down innovation and raising ethical concerns.

examples:
  - "Major tech companies becoming more secretive about their AI research breakthroughs."
  - "A decline in the number of high-impact AI research papers being openly published."
  - "The establishment of proprietary databases and algorithms that are inaccessible to the broader research community."
