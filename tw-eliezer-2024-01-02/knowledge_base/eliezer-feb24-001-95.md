claim: "The advancement in AI has made the prospect of aligning AI more challenging than 20 years ago."
premises:
  - claim: "AI systems were more legible and understandable two decades ago, unlike today's complex systems."
  - claim: "The rapid increase in AI capabilities has outpaced improvements in interpretability, making alignment harder."
counterargument_to:
  - "The advancement in AI technology simplifies the process of aligning AI with human values and intentions."
  - "Modern AI's complexity does not significantly hinder our understanding or control over it."

strongest_objection:
  - "Advanced AI systems have built-in interpretability features that were not present in earlier models, potentially making alignment easier today."

consequences_if_true:
  - "Ensuring that AI systems act in ways that are beneficial to humanity becomes increasingly difficult."
  - "The risk of unintended consequences from AI actions increases due to a lack of understanding of AI decision-making processes."
  - "The gap between AI capabilities and our understanding of these systems widens, potentially leading to scenarios where control over AI is lost."

link_to_ai_safety: This argument directly links to AI safety by highlighting the importance of understanding AI systems to ensure they align with human values.

simple_explanation: Two decades ago, AI systems were simpler and their actions more understandable, making it easier to align them with human intentions. However, today's AI has rapidly advanced in capabilities but not in interpretability, making it harder to ensure these systems act in ways we intend. This complexity and lack of transparency raise concerns about our ability to control and safely integrate AI into society.

examples:
  - "Early AI systems, like rule-based expert systems, had outputs that could be directly traced back to specific rules, making their decision-making process clear."
  - "Modern deep learning models, such as GPT-3, function as 'black boxes' where even their creators cannot fully explain why they generate certain outputs."
  - "The prediction market on manifold regarding the understanding of large language models by 2026 highlights the concern that we may know less about the workings of these systems than we did about simpler models two decades ago."
