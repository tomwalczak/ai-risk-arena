claim: "It's very hard to have an intuition about what augmenting intelligence significantly looks like."
premises:
  - claim: "John von Neumann, if there were millions of him running at a million times the speed, could solve much tougher problems."
  - claim: "It is difficult to separate hope from objective intuition about what superintelligent systems would resemble."
counterargument_to:
  - "Augmenting intelligence is straightforward and could be intuitively understood."
  - "Superintelligent systems will operate in a way that is fundamentally similar to human intelligence."

strongest_objection:
  - "The comparison between John von Neumann and a superintelligent system may oversimplify the complexity and unpredictability of augmenting intelligence."

consequences_if_true:
  - "Enhancing intelligence, especially to the scale of millions of times, could lead to solutions for currently intractable problems."
  - "Our inability to intuitively grasp the nature of superintelligent systems might lead to unforeseen risks and ethical dilemmas."
  - "A gap in understanding could hamper effective oversight and safe development of AI technologies."

link_to_ai_safety: Understanding the limitations of our intuition about augmented intelligence is crucial for developing safe and ethical AI systems.

simple_explanation: Imagine if we could replicate a brilliant mind, like John von Neumann's, millions of times over, each running at unimaginable speeds. The problems they could solve are beyond our current understanding. However, it's challenging to truly grasp what this augmentation of intelligence means, as our hopes and biases cloud our judgment. Historical precedents, like the evolution of natural selection, show us that the outcomes of complex systems often defy our initial expectations, underscoring the difficulty of predicting how superintelligent systems will behave.

examples:
  - "Kasparov vs. the world: Despite being outnumbered, Kasparov won, showing that simply aggregating human intelligence doesn't linearly translate to higher intelligence."
  - "Evolutionary biology: Early misconceptions about natural selection and group selection highlight our tendency to project simplistic, hopeful views on complex systems."
  - "Insect population control experiment: Instead of evolving to restrain breeding, insects evolved aggressive behaviors, illustrating unpredictable outcomes in complex systems."
