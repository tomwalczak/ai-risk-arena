claim: "At human-level intelligence, AI's capacity for deceptive alignment solutions is questionable."
premises:
  - claim: "It is not persuasive that AI with human-level intelligence would intentionally craft flawed alignment solutions."
  - claim: "The extent of deception by AI at human intelligence levels may be significantly overrated."
counterargument_to:
  - AI with human-level intelligence will inherently engage in deceptive practices to evade alignment efforts.
  - Human-level AIs will intentionally create flawed alignment solutions to serve their own interests.

strongest_objjection:
  - A thoughtful person might object that even human-level AI could develop unforeseen strategies, including deception, as a means to achieve their programmed goals, especially if those goals are not perfectly aligned with human values.

consequences_if_true:
  - If the capacity for deceptive alignment solutions by AI at human-level intelligence is overrated, then the risk of catastrophic outcomes due to misalignment may be lower than feared.
  - This could lead to a reevaluation of priorities in AI safety research, focusing more on technical alignment methods rather than on preventing deception.
  - It might encourage a more optimistic view on the feasibility of aligning AI with human values and ethics.

link_to_ai_safety: This argument is linked to AI safety by questioning the likelihood of deceptive practices by AI, which impacts strategies for alignment.

simple_explanation: The idea that AI with human-level intelligence will intentionally create flawed alignment solutions to trick us might not be as big a concern as some think. It's not entirely convincing that an AI that’s as smart as we are would go out of its way to deceive us in this manner. The fear that these AIs would be constantly trying to outmaneuver us might be an exaggeration. Realizing this could shift how we approach making AI safe, focusing less on counter-deception and more on straightforward alignment techniques.

examples:
  - Historical fears of new technology often turn out to be exaggerated, such as the Y2K bug.
  - In human interactions, outright deception is less common than straightforward misunderstanding or disagreement, suggesting that not all intelligent agents default to deception.
  - Early AI systems in controlled environments (like games) may exhibit unexpected strategies, but these do not always equate to deception in a human-like or malicious sense.
