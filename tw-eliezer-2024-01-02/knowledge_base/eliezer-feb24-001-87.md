claim: "Not all AI creation methodologies are doomed to 'blow up' in interesting ways."
premises:
  - claim: "The current method of scaling AI might not be the only approach."
  - claim: "There could be better, safer methodologies for AI development awaiting discovery."
counterargument_to:
  - "AI development is inherently risky and will always lead to dangerous outcomes."
  - "Scaling up current AI technologies is the only path forward in AI development."

strongest_objjection:
  - "Current AI technologies have demonstrated remarkable successes, suggesting that scaling them is the most proven and efficient method for AI advancement."

consequences_if_true:
  - "Research and investment could shift towards exploring diverse methodologies in AI development, fostering innovation."
  - "AI safety measures could be significantly enhanced by incorporating a wider range of development techniques."
  - "The field of AI could become more inclusive, bringing in perspectives that prioritize safety and ethical considerations from the start."

link_to_ai_safety: This argument underscores the importance of broadening our approach to AI development to enhance AI safety.

simple_explanation: Not all approaches to creating AI are destined to fail spectacularly. By acknowledging that our current method of simply scaling up AI might not be the only or best way forward, we open the door to discovering new, safer ways to develop AI technologies. This doesn't mean abandoning what we've learned but rather expanding our toolkit to ensure we're building AI that's not just powerful but also secure and beneficial for society.

examples:
  - "Research into AI that mimics the way humans learn, offering a more nuanced understanding and interaction with the world."
  - "Development of AI systems with built-in ethical considerations that guide decision-making processes."
  - "Exploration of decentralized AI development models to prevent monopolies and ensure broader safety and ethical standards."
