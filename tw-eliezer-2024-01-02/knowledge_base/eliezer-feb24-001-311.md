claim: "Our intuition about intelligence is limited, impacting how we perceive AI based on our understanding of intelligence."
premises:
  - claim: "Perceptions of AI and its risks are influenced by beliefs about the nature of intelligence."
  - claim: "Rethinking our approach to understanding intelligence is necessary for comprehending AI's implications and risks better."
counterargument_to:
  - The belief that we fully understand intelligence and can control the development of AI effectively.
  - The idea that AI's risks are primarily technical and can be managed with current approaches to AI safety.

strongest_objjection:
  - Some might argue that our current understanding of intelligence is sufficient for the purposes of developing and managing AI safely, and that the risks associated with AI are overstated or speculative.

consequences_if_true:
  - We might underestimate the true capabilities and risks of AI, leading to inadequate safety measures.
  - This could result in a misallocation of resources, focusing too much on narrow aspects of AI safety without addressing broader implications.
  - The development of AGI could outpace our ability to understand and control it, leading to unforeseen and potentially catastrophic consequences.

link_to_ai_safety: This argument underscores the importance of reevaluating our understanding of intelligence to enhance AI safety measures.

simple_explanation: Our intuition about what intelligence means is quite limited, which affects how we think about artificial intelligence and its potential risks. If we keep framing AI's capabilities and dangers based on our current understanding, we're likely to miss out on the full picture. This is particularly risky because the ultimate goal for companies like DeepMind and OpenAI is to create machines that are not just smart but also competent in a broad sense. This drive towards creating autonomous, competent machines without fully understanding or controlling their intelligence could lead us into dangerous territory.

examples:
  - The rapid progress in machine learning and AI algorithms outpacing our understanding of their decision-making processes.
  - The emphasis on developing AI that can win games or perform specific tasks without understanding the broader implications of such competencies.
  - The focus on creating AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) without a solid grasp of the ethical and safety considerations that should accompany such developments.
