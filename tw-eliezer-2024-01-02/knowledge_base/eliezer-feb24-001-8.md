claim: "We need to get alignment right on the 'first critical try' at operating at a 'dangerous' level of intelligence."
premises:
  - claim: "Unaligned operation at a dangerous level of intelligence kills everybody on Earth, eliminating any chance for retries."
  - claim: "Human beings excel at solving complex problems over time with multiple attempts; a scenario where failure results in global extinction does not afford such opportunities."
counterargument_to:
  - AI development can safely undergo trial and error like other technologies.
  - The risk of catastrophic failure with AI is exaggerated and manageable through progressive learning and control measures.

strongest_objection:
  - Current AI safety measures and ethical guidelines might suffice to prevent or mitigate catastrophic outcomes, making the first critical try less perilous.

consequences_if_true:
  - Immediate prioritization of AI alignment research and development to ensure safety before reaching a dangerous level of intelligence.
  - Establishment of global cooperation and oversight to manage the risks associated with powerful AI systems.
  - A possible halt or slowdown in the development of AI technologies that approach dangerous levels of intelligence until safety can be assured.

link_to_ai_safety: This argument underscores the critical importance of AI safety by highlighting the irreversible consequences of failure in aligning superintelligent AI systems.

simple_explanation: Imagine we're about to turn on a machine that's smarter than anything we've ever built, smart enough to outthink us in every way. If this machine doesn't share our goals and values from the very start, it could end up causing catastrophic damage, including potentially wiping out humanity, and we wouldn't get a do-over. This isn't like other technologies where mistakes teach us lessons for next time; in this case, there might not be a next time. That's why it's crucial we get AI alignment right on the first try, before we reach a level of AI intelligence that could pose such a danger.

examples:
  - The introduction of nuclear weapons created a situation where a single error or misjudgment could lead to catastrophic global consequences, underscoring the importance of getting things right the first time with powerful technologies.
  - The development of biological weapons, which could potentially cause global pandemics if not properly contained, illustrates the risks associated with technologies that can operate at a dangerous level of effectiveness.
  - Historical incidents of technology failures causing disasters (e.g., Chernobyl nuclear disaster) serve as a reminder that the stakes with superintelligent AI are even higher, as the potential for recovery might be non-existent.
