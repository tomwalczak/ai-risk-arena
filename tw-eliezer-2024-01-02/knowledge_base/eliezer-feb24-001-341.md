claim: "Recycling cardboard by everyone is not enough to solve the impending crisis; more significant actions are needed."
premises:
  - claim: "Simple actions like recycling are insufficient for preventing catastrophe, underscoring the need for more substantial measures."
  - claim: "Effective public outcry and action could potentially avert collective demise, indicating the necessity of actions beyond current comfort zones and political frameworks."
counterargument_to:
  - The notion that individual actions, such as recycling, are sufficient to combat global crises.
  - The belief that small-scale, everyday efforts alone can lead to significant environmental change.

strongest_objection:
  - Some may argue that advocating for widespread systemic change is unrealistic or too idealistic, given the current political and economic landscapes that favor incremental over transformative actions.

consequences_if_true:
  - A realization that current efforts are inadequate would necessitate a paradigm shift in how societies approach global crises, emphasizing systemic over individual actions.
  - It could lead to increased mobilization and activism among the general public, demanding more substantial and effective measures from political leaders.
  - There may be a significant reevaluation of priorities, with more resources allocated to addressing root causes of crises rather than merely managing symptoms.

link_to_ai_safety: This argument mirrors concerns in AI safety, where mere incremental improvements in ethical guidelines or safety measures are seen as insufficient without addressing the fundamental challenges posed by advanced AI systems.

simple_explanation: Recycling cardboard and similar actions, while important, are not enough to avert the environmental crisis we're facing. The real issue goes beyond what individuals can do in their daily lives and requires systemic change. We need to push for substantial actions that go beyond our current comfort zones and political frameworks, including strong public outcry and action. Without this shift, we risk not addressing the root causes of our problems, leading to potentially catastrophic outcomes.

examples:
  - The shift in the scientific community's focus from theoretical pursuits like string theory to practical challenges like AI alignment, as a response to recognizing the urgency and scale of potential threats.
  - Successful historical movements that have led to substantial systemic change, such as the civil rights movement in the United States, which required significant public outcry and action beyond individual efforts.
  - The rapid development and deployment of vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic, which was achieved not just through individual actions but through coordinated global effort and systemic change in how research, funding, and public health policies were approached.
