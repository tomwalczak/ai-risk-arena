claim: "Surviving worlds have a proactive plan for AI alignment."
premises:
  - claim: "These worlds began addressing lethal AI problems earlier."
  - claim: "Key individuals take real responsibility for identifying flaws in their plans."
  - claim: "A significant portion of intelligent individuals focus on AI alignment."
counterargument_to:
  - "AI development can safely progress without a concerted, proactive effort on alignment."
  - "Survival of humanity does not necessarily depend on early and focused efforts on AI alignment."
  - "The responsibility for AI safety can be distributed broadly, without a need for key individuals to take direct responsibility."

strongest_objection:
  - "Current AI development prioritizes rapid advancement and innovation over safety, and shifting a significant portion of intellectual resources towards alignment might slow progress in other beneficial areas."

consequences_if_true:
  - "A proactive plan for AI alignment becomes a prerequisite for humanity's long-term survival."
  - "There would be a significant shift in academic and professional focus towards AI alignment from other fields."
  - "Society would start prioritizing the identification and resolution of potential AI risks much earlier in the development process."

link_to_ai_safety: This argument underscores the critical importance of a strategic, community-wide focus on AI safety to ensure the long-term survival of humanity.

simple_explanation: In worlds where humanity survives the advent of advanced AI, there is a clear strategy for dealing with AI's potential dangers. These societies don't rely on a few overburdened individuals to point out risks; instead, they cultivate a culture where many of the brightest minds are dedicated to AI alignment, actively seeking out and addressing potential flaws in their approach. This proactive, collective responsibility ensures that lethal risks are managed before they become unmanageable, marking a stark contrast to a reactive or fragmented approach.

examples:
  - In a surviving world, when a potentially lethal AI problem is identified, a broad coalition of experts from various fields collaborates to devise and implement solutions, rather than leaving the problem to be addressed by a few.
  - Instead of a world where the majority of talented individuals pursue careers in fields like string theory, a significant shift occurs with many choosing to focus on AI alignment, making tangible progress in ensuring AI's safety.
  - Upon the suggestion of a new, potentially planet-threatening AI issue, the community response is to actively engage with the problem, offering solutions or solid reasons why the threat may not materialize, rather than dismissing the concern due to lack of immediate evidence.
