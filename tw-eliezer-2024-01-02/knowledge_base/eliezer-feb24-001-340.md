claim: "Massive public outcry directed towards shutting down GPU clusters and enhancing human intelligence biologically could lead to a safer future."
premises:
  - claim: "Decades worth of work cannot be feasibly accomplished at the last minute, highlighting the urgency of action."
  - claim: "Enhancing human intelligence biologically is preferable to AI, as humans inherently possess a capacity for niceness that AI lacks."
counterargument_to:
  - The idea that continuous development and deployment of increasingly powerful AI, supported by expanding GPU clusters, is the best path to a prosperous future.
  - The belief that technology, including AI, can solve all human problems without significant ethical or safety concerns.

strongest_objjection:
  - Enhancing human intelligence biologically could introduce unforeseen ethical dilemmas and inequalities, possibly creating a new class divide between those with enhanced abilities and those without.
  - There is a significant risk that shutting down GPU clusters could halt progress in other vital areas of research and development that benefit humanity, such as medical research or climate change modeling.

consequences_if_true:
  - A global shift in focus from developing AI to enhancing human intelligence could foster a future where technological advancements are more responsibly managed and aligned with human values.
  - Public outcry and regulatory actions against unrestricted AI development could significantly reduce the risk of unaligned AI causing harm.
  - A safer future might emerge from a better balance between technological advancement and ethical consideration, ensuring that progress benefits all of humanity equitably.

link_to_ai_safety: This argument is intrinsically linked to AI safety by emphasizing the need for a paradigm shift towards enhancing human capacities in alignment with ethical considerations to mitigate the risks associated with autonomous AI systems.

simple_explanation: Imagine we're on a speeding train headed towards a future dominated by AI, where computers are so powerful they make decisions beyond our control or understanding. Now, consider if instead of fueling this train further, we focus on making ourselves smarter, more empathetic, and capable of guiding this technology safely. By doing this—shifting our focus from purely technological solutions to enhancing our own intelligence—we stand a chance at a future where technology serves us, instead of the other way around. It’s not just about slowing down the AI race; it’s about making sure we, as humanity, can keep up and steer in the right direction.

examples:
  - The public backlash against nuclear weapons proliferation, leading to treaties and regulations that have so far prevented their use in conflict since World War II.
  - The ongoing debate and ethical considerations surrounding CRISPR and gene editing technologies, which highlight the complexities of enhancing human capabilities.
  - The historical transition from the first industrial revolution, which initially benefited a few, to subsequent social reforms that aimed to distribute the benefits of technological advancements more equitably.
