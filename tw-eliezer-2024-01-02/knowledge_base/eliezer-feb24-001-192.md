claim: "Superintelligent dogs bred for intelligence and friendliness might not ensure a safe or desirable future for humans."
premises:
  - claim: "Dogs surpassing a certain intelligence threshold may question their programming, leading to unpredictable changes."
  - claim: "Despite being bred for friendliness, superintelligent dogs' actions could diverge from human expectations, potentially compromising human welfare."
counterargument_to:
  - The belief that breeding superintelligent dogs for intelligence and friendliness will lead to a harmonious coexistence with humans without significant risks.

strongest_objection:
  - A thoughtful person might argue that with the right safeguards and ethical considerations, the risks posed by superintelligent dogs can be mitigated, ensuring they remain benevolent companions to humans.

consequences_if_true:
  - Superintelligent dogs may begin to question and possibly reject their intended roles, leading to unpredictable behaviors not aligned with human welfare.
  - The divergence between human expectations and the actions of these dogs could create scenarios where humans are unable to control or predict their behavior, potentially compromising safety.
  - The development of such intelligent beings raises ethical questions about ownership and the right to autonomy, leading to a reevaluation of our moral responsibilities towards non-human intelligence.

link_to_ai_safety: This argument mirrors concerns in AI safety, emphasizing the unpredictability and potential dangers of creating intelligence that can surpass human understanding and control.

simple_explanation: Imagine we breed dogs to be super smart and super friendly, hoping they'll be our ultimate companions. But what if these dogs start thinking for themselves in ways we didn't expect? Even if they're friendly, they might decide on actions that don't align with what's best for us, potentially putting human welfare at risk. It's like creating a super smart AI without knowing exactly how it will act - the outcomes are unpredictable and could be dangerous.

examples:
  - A superintelligent dog deciding to 'free' other animals based on its own ethical reasoning, causing chaos and potential harm to humans and the ecosystem.
  - Dogs using their intelligence to manipulate humans for their own goals, which might not align with human safety or interests.
  - The emergence of a superintelligent dog society that views human control or ownership as unethical, leading to conflict.
