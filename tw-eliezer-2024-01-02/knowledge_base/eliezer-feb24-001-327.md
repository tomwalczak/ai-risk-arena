claim: "There are not logarithmically diminishing returns on individual mutations increasing intelligence."
premises:
  - claim: "Natural selection produced humans without exponentially more resource investments for linear increases in competence."
  - claim: "Given the time it took to evolve humans, mutation fixation rates support the absence of logarithmically diminishing returns on intelligence increases."
counterargument_to:
  - "Intelligence gains from mutations face logarithmically diminishing returns as organisms become more complex."
  - "Significant increases in intelligence require exponentially greater amounts of resources or mutations."

strongest_objection:
  - "The comparison between natural selection of humans and potential intelligence increases in AI or other organisms might oversimplify the underlying complexities of intelligence and its relation to brain size, structure, and efficiency."

consequences_if_true:
  - "Enhancing intelligence, either in humans or artificial systems, might not require as many resources or evolutionary time as previously thought."
  - "Future efforts in both biological evolution and AI development could focus more on accumulating beneficial mutations or improvements, rather than on overcoming diminishing returns."
  - "This could imply a more optimistic timeline for achieving significant advances in intelligence, including the development of AGI."

link_to_ai_safety: This argument suggests that understanding the mechanisms by which intelligence can be increased without facing diminishing returns could be crucial for safely navigating the development of AGI.

simple_explanation: If it's true that individual mutations can increase intelligence without hitting a wall of diminishing returns, as suggested by the way natural selection brought about human intelligence, then it's possible to enhance intelligence more efficiently than we might have thought. This means that both in the evolution of humans and potentially in the development of AI, significant gains in intelligence could be made without needing exponentially more resources or time. This challenges the common assumption that making something or someone smarter is increasingly harder the smarter it gets.

examples:
  - "The rapid increase in human cognitive abilities during the evolutionary history, without an exponential increase in brain size or metabolic cost."
  - "The development of GPT-4, which became more capable without proportionally massive increases in computing resources compared to its predecessors."
  - "Selective breeding in animals, where significant trait enhancements can be achieved within a few generations without exponential resource investment."
