link_to_ai_safety: 
  - Understanding the dynamics of polarization and conformity is crucial in designing AI systems that can handle societal debates constructively without exacerbating divisions.

simple_explanation: 
  Avoiding polarization might seem like a strategy for maintaining peace, but in reality, it often leads to conformity where critical issues are swept under the rug. This approach doesn't solve underlying problems but hides them, creating a false sense of harmony. True progress comes from confronting and debating these tensions openly, not by silencing them. Embracing discussions that may initially polarize can lead to deeper understanding and more robust solutions.

examples: 
  - In authoritarian regimes where conformity is enforced, societal tensions often simmer below the surface, occasionally bursting out in unpredictable and violent ways.
  - Corporate environments that discourage dissent often miss out on innovative ideas that could challenge the status quo but also lead to significant improvements.
  - Historical movements such as the Civil Rights Movement in the United States were inherently polarizing but addressed deep-seated societal injustices and led to substantial legal and cultural changes.
