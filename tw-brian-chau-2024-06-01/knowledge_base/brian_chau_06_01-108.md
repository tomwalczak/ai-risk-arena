strongest_objection:
  - Constitutional protections are abstract and their effectiveness depends on the willingness and ability of the judiciary to enforce them without bias or influence.

consequences_if_true:

simple_explanation:
  Constitutional protections for free speech are fundamental in any democracy, designed to safeguard the expression of ideas and opinions. However, these protections face challenges as governments can exert covert pressure or manipulate legal processes, sometimes circumventing these rights in practice. The legal system, while a venue for upholding rights, often requires extensive time and resources to navigate, which can discourage or delay justice. As such, while constitutional protections are essential, they do not always function effectively in practice.

examples:
  - Long and costly legal battles to prove violations of free speech, such as litigating a case to the Supreme Court, which can take years and cost millions.
  - Governments indirectly suppressing speech by influencing or coercing private entities without passing direct legislation.
  - Instances where judicial bodies may exhibit bias or are influenced by political pressures, affecting their decisions related to free speech.
